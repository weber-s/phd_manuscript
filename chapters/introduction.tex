% The Air Quality has become one of the most environmental issue in the past decades. It is
% now well-known that the air quality cause dramatic health damage. The CAFE program (Clean
% Air For Europe) estimates that the $\PM_{2.5}$ are responsible for a decrease of a
% lifetime of 9 months in average in Europe. Another study
% from~\textcite{amannBaseline2005}
% indicates that around 42 000 premature death in France are due to the PM concentration in
% the air.  This pollution has a health impact both during a pollution peak (asthma,
% vulnerability to disease, etc) and with a chronicle exposition (cancer, pulmonary
% infection, cardiovasculary disease, etc).
%
% Nowadays, the regulation of the air quality aims to reduce the population exposition to
% the air pollutant. For instance in France since the LAURE law (Loi sur l'Air et
% l'Utilisation Rationelle de l'Énergie) in 1996, frequent measurements of the air quality
% is mandatory.  To do so, the regulation focuses its guidelines on the total mass of the PM
% present in the air.  In 2000 the ecology french minister setups several \emph{Association
% Agrées de Surveillance de la Quality de l'Air} (AASQA) which monitor, among other things,
% the $\PM_{10}$ and $\PM_{2.5}$ mass in \si{\um\per\cubic\m} in the air.  The current
% french regulation imposes a daily maximum concentration of \SI{50}{\ug\per\cubic\m} for
% $\PM_{10}$ and \SI{25}{\ug\per\cubic\m} for $\PM_{2.5}$. However, this threshold, and so
% the population exposition, is regularly exceeded in some urban cities like Paris, Lyon or
% Grenoble, or even in some other place like the Arve Valley in the Alps.
% Moreover, the PM term regroup only chaptericle which share a size lower than few micrometers,
% but they are highly different in term of chemical composition, shape or physical
% properties. It results that some PM may be more biologically active than others.  The
% metric of the mass of the PM is then not appropriate as \SI{10}{\um\per\cubic\m} of sugar
% will not have the same effect as \SI{10}{\um\per\cubic\m} of mercury for instance.  The
% fundamental question for human health is then: do all aerosols have the same health
% impact? How can we measure it? 
%
% In the past few years emerged the idea of a new metric: the Oxidant Potential (OP) of the
% {PM}. The OP is indeed linked to all the physico-chemical characteristic of the PM: the
% shape, the size and the chemical composition.  Moreover, the OP could be linked to a
% health impact more easily than the mass.  Indeed, in the human lung anti-oxidant are
% present to counteract the oxidative potential of the air (radicals, gases and also
% aerosols).  In fact, the OP is a measure of the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) carried or
% induced by aerosols. When there is an unbalance between the lung anti-oxidant defense and
% the ROS, an inflammatory response is observed
% \autocite{donaldsonOxidative2003,delfinoPotential2005,liAdjuvant2009}.  The OP of the
% PM is then considered as a promising proxy for Air Quality purpose.  Recently,
% \textcite{fangOxidative2016} coupled measurements of OP and large population
% epidemiological analyses and shows a strong correlation between entry in emergency
% dechapterment and the OP of the {PM}.
% However, such studies are quite recent and present the necessity of further investigations
% and rise new questions: how do we measure the {OP}? Could we do it standardly?  Is it
% possible to easily measure it?  Will it be useful to understand the dynamic of the sources
% and their respective environmental impact?
%
%
% My internship will be focused on the comprehension of the link between the OP and the
% chemistry of the PM and especially to an estimation of the OP contribution by sources of
% {PM} in the frame of the ExPOSURE program funded by the ANSES\footnote{ANSES: Agence
% Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail}.
% Such study is one of the first in the literature and undoubtedly the one associated with
% the biggest sample in the world.  I will first explain some generalities of the
% atmospheric sciences and aerosols (chapter~\ref{chapter:context}). Secondly, I will
% explain the methodology of the study and the sample acquisition
% (chapter~\ref{chapter:measure}).  The third chapter is focused on the results obtain
% during this internship and is split in two main sections: the mathematical development of
% an inversion framework for the attribution of the OP to the source
% (section~\ref{sec:inversionMethod} chapter~\ref{chapter:results}) and the results obtained
% with this new method (the rest of the chapter~\ref{chapter:results}).
%
% % To do so, I will follow the workflow given in
% % fig.~\ref{fig:workflow_intership}.  The internship is focused on the setup of
% % the inversion procedure to attribute an intrinsic OP of the input variable
% % (chemical species or emission sources), this is the \emph{inversion} box in the
% % figure.  The goal is to attribute an intrinsic OP per \si{\ug} of species or per
% % \si{\ug} of emission from a source.  
% %
% % The speciation of the aerosol chemistry and the OP measurement are discussed in
% % the section~\ref{sec:analysis} in chapter~\ref{chapter:measure}.  The PMF model is
% % briefly explain in the section~\ref{sec:PMF} in chapter~\ref{chapter:measure} and was
% % run by several persons (Dalia Salameh for the site of the SOURCES program,
% %     Alexandre Sylvestre for the sites of Nice, Florie Chevrier for the sites of
% % the DECOMBIO program). The methodology of the inversion is detailed in the
% % section~\ref{sec:inversionMethod} in chapter~\ref{chapter:results}.
