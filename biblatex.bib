Spiking the reaction media with inorganic and organic selenium compounds demonstrated that several volatile selenium species could be formed under these simulated conditions. Selenoamino acids react to produce significant amounts of volatile selenium species in both light and dark conditions. Products formed include dimethyl selenide (DMSe), dimethyl selenyl sulphide (DMSeS) and dimethyl diselenide (DMDSe). Inorganic selenium oxyanions added to the synthetic reaction media did not form volatile species via abiotic reactions despite the presence of strong methylating agents. These results suggest that the formation of stable volatile species from bio-organic selenium compounds can occur via abiotic reactions in the marine photic zone.

The model reproduces surface temperature and relative humidity profiles over the period well and captures the observed variations in key atmospheric pollutants. We highlight the sensitivity of simulated pollutant levels to meteorological variables and model resolution and in particular to treatment of turbulent mixing in the planetary boundary layer. We note that simulating particle composition in the region remains a challenge, and we overpredict NH\textsubscript{4} and NO\textsubscript{3} at the expense of SO\textsubscript{4}. We find that the emission controls implemented for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit period made a relatively small contribution to improved air quality (20\&thinsp;\%–26\&thinsp;\%), highlighting the important role played by favourable meteorological conditions over this period. We demonstrate that the same controls applied under less favourable meteorological conditions would have been insufficient in reducing pollutant levels to meet the required standards. Continued application of these controls over the 6-week period considered would only have reduced the number of haze days when daily mean fine particulate matter exceeds 75\&thinsp;µg m\textsuperscript{−3} from 15 to 13\&thinsp;d (days). Our study highlights the limitations of current emission controls and the need for more stringent measures over a wider region during meteorologically stagnant weather.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A hybrid environmental receptor model (HERM) that unifies the theory of effective-variance chemical mass balance (EV-CMB) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) models was developed to support the weight-of-evidence approach of air pollution source apportionment. The HERM software is capable of (1) conducting EV-CMB analysis for multiple samples in a single model run; (2) calculating EV-CMB and PMF source contributions, as well as middle grounds between the two (i.e., hybrid mode), using partial source information available for the study region; (3) reporting source contribution uncertainties and sample-/species-specific fitting performance measures; and (4) interfacing with MS Excel for convenient data inputs/outputs and analysis. Initial testing with simulated and real-world PM2.5 (fine particulate air pollutants with aerodynamic diameter {$<$}2.5 μm) data sets show that HERM reproduces EV-CMB results from existing software but with more tolerance to collinearity and better uncertainty estimates. It also shows that partial source information helps reduce rotational ambiguity in PMF, thus producing more accurate partitioning between highly correlated sources. Moreover, source profiles generated from the hybrid mode can be more representative of the study region than those acquired from other locales or calculated by PMF with no source information. Strategies to use HERM for source apportionment are recommended.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Particulate matter (PM) from traffic and other sources has been associated with adverse health effects. One unifying theory is that PM, whatever its source, acts on the human body via its capacity to cause damaging oxidation reactions related to its content of pro-oxidants components. Few epidemiological studies have investigated particle oxidative potential (OP) and health. We conducted a time series analysis to assess associations between daily particle OP measures and numbers of deaths and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
METHODS: During 2011 and 2012 particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 and 10μm (PM2.5 and PM10 respectively) were collected daily on Partisol filters located at an urban background monitoring station in Central London. Particulate OP was assessed based on the capacity of the particles to oxidize ascorbate (OP(AA)) and glutathione (OP(GSH)) from a simple chemical model reflecting the antioxidant composition of human respiratory tract lining fluid. Particulate OP, expressed as \% loss of antioxidant per μg of PM, was then multiplied by the daily concentrations of PM to derive the daily OP of PM mass concentrations (\% loss per m(3)). Daily numbers of deaths and age- and cause-specific hospital admissions in London were obtained from national registries. Poisson regression accounting for seasonality and meteorology was used to estimate the percentage change in risk of death or admission associated with an interquartile increment in particle OP.
RESULTS: We found little evidence for adverse associations between OP(AA) and OP(GSH) and mortality. Associations with cardiovascular admissions were generally positive in younger adults and negative in older adults with confidence intervals including 0\%. For respiratory admissions there was a trend, from positive to negative associations, with increasing age although confidence intervals generally included 0\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study, the first to analyse daily particle OP measures and mortality and admissions in a large population over two years, found little evidence to support the hypothesis that short-term exposure to particle OP is associated with adverse health effects. Further studies with improved exposure assessment and longer time series are required to confirm or reject the role of particle OP in triggering exacerbations of disease.},

Ozone and ambient particles are the main pollutants contributing to the exacerbation of these pathologies. Their toxicity resides in their ability to generate an oxidative stress. The level of oxidative stress and the specificity of the cellular responses result from complex interactions between pro- and anti-oxidants, leading to differentiated cellular strategies. Hierarchical biological responses: adaptation, inflammation, lesions, can be determined according to the oxidative insult and individual anti-oxidant capacities.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biological mechanisms involved in inflammatory response to air pollution are not clearly understood.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we assessed the association of short-term air pollutant exposure with inflammatory markers and lung function.
METHODS: We studied a cohort of 158 asthmatic and 50 nonasthmatic school-age children, followed an average of 22 weeks. We conducted spirometric tests, measurements of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), interleukin-8 (IL-8) in nasal lavage, and pH of exhaled breath condensate every 15 days during follow-up. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: An increase of 17.5 µg/m3 in the 8-hr moving average of PM2.5 levels (interquartile range) was associated with a 1.08-ppb increase in FeNO [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.01–1.16] and a 1.07-pg/mL increase in IL-8 (95\% CI 0.98–1.19) in asthmatic children and a 1.16 pg/ml increase in IL-8 (95\% CI, 1.00–1.36) in nonasthmatic children. The 5-day accumulated average of exposure to particulate matter {$<$} 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diamter (PM2.5) was significantly inversely associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) (p = 0.048) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (p = 0.012) in asthmatic children and with FVC (p = 0.021) in nonasthmatic children. FeNO and FEV1 were inversely associated (p = 0.005) in asthmatic children.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to PM2.5 resulted in acute airway inflammation and decrease in lung function in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic children.

  abstract = {For decades, oil extraction in rural sites in the North Amazon Region (NAR) in Ecuador, have generated mixtures of potentially toxic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metal(loid)s. The main national refinery and the thermal power plant located in Esmeraldas, on the North Pacific Coast (NPC), are also considered as important sources of air contamination. Particulate matter (PM10) emitted at both sites could induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the lungs upon inhalation and could be associated with respiratory diseases. In this study, PM10 mass composition was monitored over a two-year period in both regions: NAR (close to oil platforms and open flares) and NPC (in a public school close to the refinery). PM10 composition was assessed in terms of metal(loid)s, organic and elementary carbon (OC, EC), monosaccharides (levoglucosan, mannosan, galactosan), glucose, polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, arabitol), water soluble ions and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs, oxy-PAHs and nitro-PAHs). Additionally, three complementary biochemical and acellular tests were performed to evaluate the oxidative potential (OP). Results show that the PM10 mass and elemental concentrations were higher in NPC than in NAR. Barium and Mo concentrations, commonly used in oil operations, were up to 1000-fold higher than values recorded in other regions of Ecuador. OC/EC ratios and polyols concentrations were higher in NAR than in NPC, indicating a larger biogenic contribution to the PM mass in this region. In NAR, the main sources associated with ROS burden were biogenic emissions and oil production, as indicated by positive correlations between OP, sugars, Ba, some PAHs and oxy-PAHs. On the other hand, in NPC, associations between NH4+, Ba, As and Ni imply that oil refining and industrial activities are the main contributors to the OP of PM10.},

BALG/c mice given 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1 relative to the days of immunization with 0.5 mug of SSS-II had a 20-fold increment (11,383 increased to 199,917) in the number of splenic plaque-forming cells enumerated on day 5 compared with untreated, immunized controls. This effect has been attributed to the elimination of subpopulation of thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) that has suppressor function. The present series of experiments relate the augmented antibody response to SSS-II in mice treated with ALS to increased host resistance after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, type III (Pn-II). The 50\%  lethal dose of Pn-III in niminnunized mice was 102 and the 100\% lethal dose was 103 organisms. Mice immunized with 0.5 mug of SSS-III and challenged 5 days later with Pn-III were completely protected against a dose of up to 108 organisms. Mice treated with 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1, immunized with SSS-III on day 0, and challenged with 2.5 X 10(9) Pn-III on day 5 had a mean survival time of greater than 100 h compared with 16 h for immunized non-serum-treated controls. Animals given a single injection of ALS before immunization showed no increase in resistance, whereas mice treated after immunization had significant prolongation of survival times. Untreated, immunized mice challenged with 5 X 10(9), 1 X 5 X 10(8) Pn-II survived 14 to 19 h, whereas ALS-treated animals had mean survival times of 48, 174, and 222 h, respectively. These findings suggest that immunoregulatory T cells may have a biologically significant effect in a narrow zone in which the normal host immune response is insufficient but still potentially capable of providing some additional degree of protection if suppressor cells are elimated.},

These approaches are applied to Atlanta, GA at a 250 m grid resolution to obtain daily 24-hr averaged PM2.5 and 1-hr max CO and NOx concentrations during the years 2003–2008 for use in health studies. The modeled concentrations provide comprehensive estimates with steep spatial gradients near roadways, secondary formation and loss, and effects of regional sources that can influence daily variation in ambient pollutant concentrations. Results show high temporal and spatial correlation and low biases across monitors, providing accurate pollutant concentration estimates for epidemiologic analyses.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress is a potential mechanism of action for particulate matter (PM) toxicity and can occur when the body’s antioxidant capacity cannot counteract or detoxify harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to an excess presence of ROS. ROS are introduced to the body via inhalation of PM with these species present on and/or within the particles (particle-bound ROS) and/or through catalytic generation of ROS in vivo after inhaling redox-active PM species (oxidative potential, OP). The recent development of acellular OP measurement techniques has led to a surge in research across the globe. In this review, particle-bound ROS techniques are discussed briefly while OP measurements are the focus due to an increasing number of epidemiologic studies using OP measurements showing associations with adverse health effects in some studies. The most common OP measurement techniques, including the dithiothreitol assay, glutathione assay, and ascorbic acid assay, are discussed along with evidence for utility of OP measurements in epidemiologic studies and PM characteristics that drive different responses between assay types (such as species composition, emission source, and photochemistry). Overall, most OP assays respond to metals like copper than can be found in emission sources like vehicles. Some OP assays respond to organics, especially photochemically aged organics, from sources like biomass burning. Select OP measurements have significant associations with certain cardiorespiratory end points, such as asthma, congestive heart disease, and lung cancer. In fact, multiple studies have found that exposure to OP measured using the dithiothreitol and glutathione assays drives higher risk ratios for certain cardiorespiratory outcomes than PM mass, suggesting OP measurements may be integrating the health-relevant fraction of PM and will be useful tools for future health analyses. The compositional impacts, including species and emission sources, on OP could have serious implications for health-relevant PM exposure. Though more work is needed, OP assays show promise for health studies as they integrate the impacts of PM species and properties on catalytic redox reactions into one measurement, and current work highlights the importance of metals, organic carbon, vehicles, and biomass burning emissions to PM exposures that could impact health.},

  abstract = {Oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter measures the ability of particles to catalytically generate reactive oxygen species while simultaneously depleting antioxidants, leading to oxidative stress and, in turn, inflammation in the respiratory tract and cardiovascular system. OP measurements have been linked with adverse cardiorespiratory endpoints, such as asthma/wheezing, lung cancer, and ischemic heart disease. However, measurements of OP are limited, restricting the area over which epidemiologic analyses can be performed. In this work, a modeling approach is developed and evaluated that uses limited measurements of water-soluble OP and PM2.5 source impact analysis to estimate OP over a large spatial domain (eastern United States). The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was used to measure daily OP of water-soluble PM2.5 from June 2012 to July 2013 across four sites in the southeastern United States. Daily PM2.5 source impacts were estimated using CMAQ-DDM during the same time period and related to OPDTT measurements via multivariate linear regression. This regression was then applied to spatial fields of daily CMAQ-DDM source impacts across the eastern United States to provide daily spatially-varying OPDTT estimates. Backward selection during regression development showed vehicle and biomass burning emissions to be significantly predictive of OPDTT, as observed in previous studies. The fire source impact was the largest contributor to OPDTT (29\%) across the study domain during the study time period, and both spatial and seasonal variations were largely driven by fires. Vehicular impacts, especially diesel impacts, were more significant in urban areas. This CMAQ-DDM modeling approach provides a powerful tool for integrating OP measurements from multiple locations and times into a model that can provide spatio-temporal exposure fields of OPDTT across a wide spatial domain for use in health analyses, and the results offer insight into the large-scale spatial distribution of OPDTT driven by emission source impacts.},

  abstract = {The measurement of particulate matter induced oxidative potential activity by dithiothreitol (DTT) as an alternative quantitative method has been of recent interest. The mechanism of this process is not well understood. Proposed mechanisms often involve formation of the hydrogen peroxide as the final step. Evidence suggests that this may not be the dominant route. We applied computational methods to determine a possible alternative mechanism in the presence of •OH radical production. An energetically favored mechanism was found for DTT-chemical reactivity reaction which is consistent with previously reported experimental results.},

  abstract = {In this study, the performance of two types of source apportionment models was evaluated by assessing the results provided by 40 different groups in the framework of an intercomparison organised by FAIRMODE WG3 (Forum for air quality modelling in Europe, Working Group 3). The evaluation was based on two performance indicators: z-scores and the root mean square error weighted by the reference uncertainty (RMSEu), with pre-established acceptability criteria. By involving models based on completely different and independent input data, such as receptor models (RMs) and chemical transport models (CTMs), the intercomparison provided a unique opportunity for their cross-validation. In addition, comparing the CTM chemical profiles with those measured directly at the source contributed to corroborate the consistency of the tested model results. The most commonly used RM was the US EPA- PMF version 5. RMs showed very good performance for the overall dataset (91\% of z-scores accepted) while more difficulties were observed with the source contribution time series (72\% of RMSEu accepted). Industrial activities proved to be the most difficult sources to be quantified by RMs, with high variability in the estimated contributions. In the CTMs, the sum of computed source contributions was lower than the measured gravimetric PM10 mass concentrations. The performance tests pointed out the differences between the two CTM approaches used for source apportionment in this study: brute force (or emission reduction impact) and tagged species methods. The sources meeting the z-score and RMSEu acceptability criteria tests were 50\% and 86\%, respectively. The CTM source contributions to PM10 were in the majority of cases lower than the RM averages for the corresponding source. The CTMs and RMs source contributions for the overall dataset were more comparable (83\% of the z-scores accepted) than their time series (successful RMSEu in the range 25\% - 34\%). The comparability between CTMs and RMs varied depending on the source: traffic/exhaust and industry were the source categories with the best results in the RMSEu tests while the most critical ones were soil dust and road dust. The differences between RMs and CTMs source reconstructions confirmed the importance of cross validating the results of these two families of models.},

  abstract = {The use of high time resolution datasets of aerosol organic and inorganic species as input for receptor models poses a number of challenges. The estimation of uncertainties differ between different analytical methods and the number of chemical species may considerably vary among the different techniques. In this study, an approach to harmonise the uncertainties of different online datasets for their combined use in source apportionment with positive matrix factorization (PMF) is presented. The concentration of inorganic ions, organic fragments and trace elements were measured in a Po Valley background site using offline and online methods. Six-hour PM 2.5 samples were collected on filters and chemical analyses were carried out offline. Parallel hourly online measurements were made using the Xact 625 (CES LLC) XRF analyser and the Q-ACSM (Aerodyne Research Inc.) spectrometer. Online and offline methods produced comparable results for the major chemical component and some trace elements, while others (Ba, Ni, As and Se) showed limited comparability between the two methods. To ensure the consistency of the final PMF results, a multistep approach was adopted. In the first step PMF was run with only the offline dataset, in the second step only the online organic data were used and in a third step the PMF run was executed using only the online inorganic species. In the first three steps running PMF with homogeneous data made it possible to identify the main sources and produce chemical profiles to be used as internal reference for the final fourth step in which all the online species (major inorganic ions, m/z of organic fragments and trace elements) were combined. The sources of the final solution were developed using internally consistent chemical profiles and those from the literature and were validated by analysing the source diurnal variations and by comparison with external tracers. The sources identified were: biomass burning, aged biomass burning, secondary ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate, traffic, steel industry and waste thermal treatment. The source profiles with a large set of organic and inorganic species (87) and associated source diurnal variations resulting from this study are expected to serve as reference for future studies.},

Public health insurance claims, hospital admission rates for cardiac and respiratory disease, pneumonia cases, mortality records, influenza reports, temperature, and air pollutant concentrations are analyzed for December-February 1952-1953 and compared with those for the previous year or years. Mortality rates for the smog episode from December 1952 to February 1953 were 50-300\% higher than the previous year. Claims that the smog only elevated health risks during and immediately following the peak fog 5-9 December 1952 and that an influenza epidemic accounted fully for persisting mortality increases in the first 2 months of 1953 are rejected. We estimate about 12,000 excess deaths occurred from December 1952 through February 1953 because of acute and persisting effects of the 1952 London smog. Pollution levels during the London smog were 5-19 times above current regulatory standards and guidelines and approximate current levels in some rapidly developing regions. Ambient pollution in many regions poses serious risks to public health.},

  abstract = {The London smog of 1952 is one of history's most important air pollution episodes in terms of its impact on science, public perception of air pollution, and government regulation. The association between health and air pollution during the episode was evident as a strong rise in air pollution levels was immediately followed by sharp increases in mortality and morbidity. However, mortality in the months after the smog was also elevated above normal levels. An initial government report proposed the hypothesis that influenza was responsible for high mortality during these months. Estimates of the number of influenza deaths were generated using multiple methods, indicating that only a fraction of the deaths in the months after the smog could be attributable to influenza. Sensitivity analysis reveals that only an extremely severe influenza epidemic could account for the majority of the excess deaths for this time period. Such an epidemic would be on the order of twice the case-fatality rate and quadruple the incidence observed in a general medical practice during the winter of 1953. These results underscore the need for diligence regarding extremely high air pollution that still exists in many parts of the world.},

Quantification of PM2.5 oxidative potential (i.e., the ability of PM to promote oxidative reactions in solution) is a relatively new paradigm for exploring health risks associated with the various chemical compositions of ambient PM2.5. PM2.5 oxidative potential is commonly measured with the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, where the DTT loss rate is measured when mixed with a PM2.5 sample extract. However, the DTT assay is time consuming and laborious, with only a few reported automation attempts. We introduce and evaluate a semi-automated DTT assay using a traditional HPLC combined with either UV/vis absorbance or electrochemical detection that has comparable accuracy and sensitivity to manual approaches. Commercial and custom-made electrochemical detectors are also compared before measuring ambient PM2.5 filter samples. The optimized, semi-automated assay can process six samples per hour (an 83\% time savings compared to manual analysis). Cost becomes significant for large-scale studies and was also considered; electrochemical detection saved 40\% on consumables cost compared to UV/vis detection. The presented liquid-handling automation can be applied to a variety of autosamplers in other laboratories for DTT assay semi-automation.},

The potential associations between the organic PM determinants and the adverse cellular effects (i.e. cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, DNA damage, oxidative DNA adduct formation, and inflammatory response) induced by the extractable organic matter (EOM) of PM, previously measured in Velali et~al. (2016b), were investigated by bivariate correlations and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Partial Least Square regression analysis (PLS) was also employed in order to identify the chemical classes mainly involved in the EOM-induced toxicological endpoints in the various particle size fractions. Results indicated that particle size range {$<$}0.49~μm was the major carrier of PM mass and organic compounds at both sites. All toxic organic compounds exhibited higher concentrations at the urban traffic site, except PCBs and OCPs that did not exhibit intra-urban variations. Conversely, wintertime levels of levoglucosan were significantly higher at the urban background site as a result of residential biomass burning. The PLS regression analysis allowed quite good prediction of the EOM-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity based on the determined organic chemical classes, particularly for the finest size fraction of PM. Nevertheless, it is expected that other chemical constituents, not determined here, also contribute to the measured toxicological responses.},

  abstract = {Air pollution is of major concern throughout the world and the use of modeling tools to analyze and forecast the pollutant concentrations in complex orographic areas remains challenging. This work proposes an exhaustive framework to analyze the ability of models to simulate the air quality over the French Alps up to 1.2 km resolution over Grenoble and the Arve Valley. The on-line coupled suite of models CHIMERE-WRF is used in its recent version to analyze a 1 month episode in November\&ndash;December 2013. As expected, an improved resolution increases the concentrations close to the emission areas and reduced the negative bias for Particulate Matter that is the usual weakness of air quality models. However, the nitrate concentrations seem overestimated with at the same time an overestimation of surface temperature in the morning by WRF. Different WRF settings found in the literature are tested to improve the results, particularly the ability of the meteorological model to simulate the strong thermal inversions in the morning. Wood burning is one of the main contributor of air pollution during the period ranging from 80 to 90\% of the Organic Matter. The activation of the on-line coupling has a moderate impact on the background concentrations but surprisingly a change of Particulate Matter (PM) concentrations in the valley will affect more the meteorology nearby high altitude areas than in the valley. This phenomenon is the result of a chain of processes involving the radiative effects and the water vapor column gradients in complex orographic areas. At last, the model confirms that the surrounding glaciers are largely impacted by long range transport of desert dust. However, in wintertime some outbreaks of anthropogenic pollution from the valley when the synoptic situation changes can be advected up to the nearby high altitude areas, then deposited.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The Po Valley is one of the largest European regions with a remarkably high concentration level of atmospheric pollutants, both for particulate and gaseous compounds. In the last decade stringent regulations on air quality standards and on anthropogenic emissions have been set by the European Commission, including also for PM\textsubscript{2.5} and its main components since 2008. These regulations have led to an overall improvement in air quality across Europe, including the Po Valley and specifically PM\textsubscript{10}, as shown in a previous study by Bigi and Ghermandi (2014). In order to assess the trend and variability in PM\textsubscript{2.5} in the Po Valley and its role in the decrease in PM\textsubscript{10}, we analysed daily gravimetric equivalent concentration of PM\textsubscript{2.5} and of PM\textsubscript{10–2.5} at 44 and 15 sites respectively across the Po Valley. The duration of the times series investigated in this work ranges from 7 to 10 years. For both PM sizes, the trend in deseasonalized monthly means, annual quantiles and in monthly frequency distribution was estimated: this showed a significant decreasing trend at several sites for both size fractions and mostly occurring in winter. All series were tested for a significant weekly periodicity (a proxy to estimate the impact of primary anthropogenic emissions), yielding positive results for summer PM\textsubscript{2.5} and for summer and winter PM\textsubscript{10–2.5}. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed moderate variability in PM\textsubscript{2.5} across the valley, with two to three main clusters, dividing the area in western, eastern and southern/Apennines foothill sectors. The trend in atmospheric concentration was compared with the time series of local emissions, vehicular fleet details and fuel sales, suggesting that the decrease in PM\textsubscript{2.5} and in PM\textsubscript{10} originates from a drop both in primary and in precursors of secondary inorganic aerosol emissions, largely ascribed to vehicular traffic. Potentially, the increase in biomass burning emissions in winter and the modest decrease in NH\textsubscript{3} weaken an otherwise even larger drop in atmospheric concentrations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Diesel exhaust has been classified a probable human carcinogen, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that employers reduce workers' exposures. Because diesel exhaust is a chemically complex mixture containing thousands of compounds, some measure of exposure must be selected. Previously used methods involving gravimetry or analysis of the soluble organic fraction of diesel soot lack adequate sensitivity and selectivity for low-level determination of particulate diesel exhaust; a new analytical approach was therefore needed. In this paper, results of investigation of a thermal-optical technique for analysis of the carbonaceous fraction of particulate diesel exhaust are reported. With this technique, speciation of organic and elemental carbon is accomplished through temperature and atmosphere control, and by an optical feature that corrects for pyrolytically generated carbon, or “char,” which is formed during the analysis of some materials. The thermal-optical method was selected because the instrument has desirable design features not present in other carbon analyzers. Although various carbon types are determined, elemental carbon is the superior marker of diesel particulate matter because elemental carbon constitutes a large fraction of the particulate mass, it can be quantified at low levels, and its only significant source in most workplaces is the diesel engine. Exposure-related issues and results of investigation of various sampling methods for particulate diesel exhaust also are discussed. †Disclaimer: Mention of company name or product does not constitute endorsement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

  abstract = {Located in the Mediterranean Basin and close to Marseille (France), Fos-sur-Mer is situated in the vicinity of industrial harbor and agricultural lands. Its location makes it prone to mixed pollution contributions, combining the influence of residential, industrial, agricultural, maritime road and traffic sources. For this study, the origins of carbonaceous particles sampled over several months are investigated by a coupled approach based on analyses of radiocarbon (14C), elemental to total carbon ratio (EC/TC) and various molecular tracers (levoglucosan, methoxyphenols, malic and glyceric acids), giving information about their background origins. Accelerator mass spectrometry with a gas ion source give the opportunity to quantify the fossil and non-fossil fractions for each individual sample, avoiding to pool them. Analyzing 14C in micro-samples (down to a few μg of carbon) complements the approach based on chemical tracers, which are useful to identify sources, but insufficient to quantify accurately the modern and fossil carbon fractions. The measurements in about 30 samples collected during summer and fall/winter 2013, allow the detection of a strong seasonality of the pollution: the fall/winter PM2.5 fraction concentration equals to three times the summer concentration and we observe a significant fluctuation of the relative contributions of fossil and non-fossil fractions (fNF is ≈ 0.83 for fall/winter samples and ≈0.59 for summer samples). Significant correlations between 14C, levoglucosan and different methoxyphenols, allow the identification and quantification of a major influence of biomass burning emissions during fall and winter. Biomass burning organic carbon (OCBB) and elemental carbon (ECBB) contribute to 45\% and 8\% of the TC, respectively, whereas their total contribution is only 3\% in summer samples. Biogenic emissions from the vegetation are the main sources of carbon during summer (≈57\%). Significant correlations between summer OCbio and malic acid and DL glyceric acid suggest a secondary origin for this fraction. The total fossil carbon concentration (ECF and OCF) from vehicular, shipping and industrial sources is constant throughout the year, which is compatible with intense road and maritime traffics and industrial activity during both seasons. Overall, our study based on 14C and molecular tracers illustrates the power of a coupled approach in order to both identify and quantify biomass burning, biogenic, traffic and industrial sources of carbonaceous aerosols, forming a complex mix of background PM origins in a typical industrious harbor of the Mediterranean region.},

  abstract = {The oxidative potential (OP) and chemical characteristics of fine particles collected from urban, roadside, rural, and industrial sites in Korea during spring, summer, fall, and winter seasons and an urban site in the Philippines during dry and wet seasons were examined. Significant differences in the OP of fine particles among sites and seasons were found. The industrial site yielded the highest OP activity (both mass and volume-normalized OP) among the sites, suggesting the strongest reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating capability of industry source-dominant PM2.5. Seasonal data show that OP activities increased during the spring and summer possibly due to increased heavy metals caused by dust events and secondary organic aerosols formed by strong photochemical activity, respectively. The strength of the OP association with the chemical components highlights the influence of organic carbon and transition metals on the OP of ambient fine particles. The two OP assays (dithiothreitol (DTT) and electron spin resonance (ESR)) having different ROS-generating mechanisms were found to have different sensitivities to the chemical components facilitating a complementary analysis of the OP of ambient fine particles. Multiple linear regression model equations (OP as a function of chemical components) which were dependent on the sites were derived. A comparison of the daily OP and hazard index (HI) (the ratio of the measured mass concentration to the reference mass concentration of fine particles) suggests that the HI may not be sufficient to accurately estimate the health effects of fine particles, and a direct or indirect measurement of toxicity such as OP should be required in addition to the concentration level.},

Here, the importance and fate of N deposition in a watershed was evaluated along a montane to urban gradient, using a multi-isotopic tracers approach (Δ17O, δ15N, δ18O of nitrate, δ2H and δ18O of water). In this setting, the montane streams had higher proportions of atmospheric nitrate compared to urban streams, and exported more atmospheric nitrate on a yearly basis (0.35 vs 0.10 kg-Nha−1yr−1). In urban areas, nitrate exports were driven by groundwater, whereas in the catchment head nitrate exports were dominated by surface runoff. The main sources of nitrate to the montane streams were microbial nitrification and atmospheric deposition, whereas microbial nitrification and sewage leakage contributed most to urban streams. Based on the measurement of δ15N and δ18O-NO3−, biological processes such as denitrification or N assimilation were not predominant in any streams in this study. The observed low δ15N and δ18O range of terrestrial nitrate (i.e., nitrate not coming from atmospheric deposition) in surface water compared to literature suggests that atmospheric deposition may be underestimated as a direct source of N.},

  abstract = {The significance of foliar uptake of nitrogen (N) compounds in natural conditions is not well understood, despite growing evidence of its importance to plant nutrition. In subalpine meadows, N-limitation fosters the dominance of specific subalpine plant species, which in turn ensures the provision of essential ecosystems services. Understanding how these plants absorb N and from which sources is important in predicting ecological consequences of increasing N deposition. Here, we investigate the sources of N to plants from subalpine meadows with distinct land-use history in the French Alps, using the triple isotopes (Δ17O, δ18O, and δ15N) of plant tissue nitrate (NO3−). We use this approach to evaluate the significance of foliar uptake of atmospheric NO3− (NO3−atm). The foliar uptake of NO3−atm accounted for 4–16\% of the leaf NO3− content, and contributed more to the leaf NO3− pool after peak biomass. Additionally, the gradual 15N enrichment of NO3− from the soil to the leaves reflected the contribution of NO3−atm assimilation to plants’ metabolism. The present study confirms that foliar uptake is a potentially important pathway for NO3−atm into subalpine plants. This is of major significance as N emissions (and deposition) are predicted to increase globally in the future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The widespread use of Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometers (AMS) has greatly improved real-time organic aerosol (OA) monitoring, providing mass spectra that contain sufficient information for source apportionment. However, AMS field deployments remain expensive and demanding, limiting the acquisition of long-term datasets at many sampling sites. The offline application of aerosol mass spectrometry entailing the analysis of nebulized water extracted filter samples (offline-AMS) increases the spatial coverage accessible to AMS measurements, being filters routinely collected at many stations worldwide. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} PM\textsubscript{1} (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; 1 µm) filter samples were collected during an entire year in Lithuania at three different locations representative of three typical environments of the southeast Baltic region: Vilnius (urban background), Rūgšteliškis (rural terrestrial), and Preila (rural coastal). Aqueous filter extracts were nebulized in Ar, yielding the first AMS measurements of water-soluble atmospheric organic aerosol (WSOA) without interference from air fragments. This enables direct measurement of the CO\textsuperscript{+} fragment contribution, whose intensity is typically assumed to be equal to that of CO\textsubscript{2}\textsuperscript{+}. Offline-AMS spectra reveal that the water-soluble CO\textsubscript{2}\textsuperscript{+} : CO\textsuperscript{+} ratio not only shows values systematically \&gt; 1 but is also dependent on season, with lower values in winter than in summer. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} AMS WSOA spectra were analyzed using positive matrix factorization (PMF), which yielded four factors. These factors included biomass burning OA (BBOA), local OA (LOA) contributing significantly only in Vilnius, and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors, summer OOA (S-OOA) and background OOA (B-OOA), distinguished by their seasonal variability. The contribution of traffic exhaust OA (TEOA) was not resolved by PMF due to both low concentrations and low water solubility. Therefore, the TEOA concentration was estimated using a chemical mass balance approach, based on the concentrations of hopanes, specific markers of traffic emissions. AMS-PMF source apportionment results were consistent with those obtained from PMF applied to marker concentrations (i.e., major inorganic ions, OC\&thinsp;/\&thinsp;EC, and organic markers including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, hopanes, long-chain alkanes, monosaccharides, anhydrous sugars, and lignin fragmentation products). OA was the largest fraction of PM\textsubscript{1} and was dominated by BBOA during winter with an average concentration of 2 µg m\textsuperscript{−3} (53 \% of OM), while S-OOA, probably related to biogenic emissions, was the prevalent OA component during summer with an average concentration of 1.2 µg m\textsuperscript{−3} (45 \% of OM). {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} PMF ascribed a large part of the CO\textsuperscript{+} explained variability (97 \%) to the OOA and BBOA factors. Accordingly, we discuss a new CO\textsuperscript{+} parameterization as a function of CO\textsubscript{2}\textsuperscript{+} and C\textsubscript{2}H\textsubscript{4}O\textsubscript{2}\textsuperscript{+} fragments, which were selected to describe the variability of the OOA and BBOA factors.{$<$}/p{$><$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Primary biological organic aerosols (PBOA) represent a major component of the coarse organic matter (OMCOARSE, aerodynamic diameter {$>$} 2.5 μm). Although this fraction affects human health and the climate, its quantification and chemical characterization currently remain elusive. We present the first quantification of the entire PBOACOARSE mass and its main sources by analyzing sizesegregated filter samples collected during the summer and winter at the rural site of Payerne (Switzerland), representing a continental Europe background environment. The size-segregated water-soluble OM was analyzed by a newly developed offline aerosol mass spectrometric technique (AMS). Collected spectra were analyzed by three-dimensional positive matrix factorization (3D-PMF), showing that PBOA represented the main OMCOARSE source during summer and its contribution to PM10 was comparable to that of secondary organic aerosol. We found substantial cellulose contributions to OMCOARSE, which in combination with gas chromatography mass spectrometry molecular markers quantification, underlined the predominance of plant debris. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis instead revealed that the sum of bacterial and fungal spores mass represented only a minor OMCOARSE fraction ({$<$}0.1\%). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis of C and N binding energies throughout the size fractions revealed an organic N increase in the PM10 compared to PM1 consistent with AMS observations.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} We have developed an integrated model system, EVA (Economic Valuation of Air pollution), based on the impact-pathway chain, to assess the health-related economic externalities of air pollution resulting from specific emission sources or sectors, which can be used to support policy-making with respect to emission control. Central for the system is a newly developed tagging method capable of calculating the contribution from a specific emission source or sector to the overall air pollution levels, taking into account the non-linear atmospheric chemistry. The main objective of this work is to identify the anthropogenic emission sources in Europe and Denmark that contribute the most to human health impacts. In this study, we applied the EVA system to Europe and Denmark, with a detailed analysis of health-related external costs from the ten major emission sectors and their relative contributions. The paper contains a thorough description of the EVA system, the main results from the assessment of the main contributors and a discussion of the most important atmospheric chemical reactions relevant for interpreting the results. The main conclusion from the analysis is that the major contributors to health-related external costs are major power production, agriculture, road traffic, and non-industrial domestic combustion, including wood combustion. We conclude that when regulating the emissions of ammonia from the agricultural sector, both the impacts on nature and on human health should be taken into account. This study confirms that air pollution constitutes a serious problem for human health and that the related external costs are considerable. The results in this work emphasize the importance of defining the right questions in the decision-making process. The results from assessing the impacts from each emission sector depend clearly on the assumption that the other emission sectors are not changed, especially emissions changing concentrations of atmospheric OH and therefore lifetimes of other chemical species.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Previous assessments of global attributable disease burden have been limited to urban areas or by coarse spatial resolution of concentration estimates. Recent developments in remote sensing, global chemical-transport models, and improvements in coverage of surface measurements facilitate virtually complete spatially resolved global air pollutant concentration estimates. We combined these data to generate global estimates of long-term average ambient concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) and ozone at 0.1° × 0.1° spatial resolution for 1990 and 2005. In 2005, 89\% of the world’s population lived in areas where the World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline of 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 (annual average) was exceeded. Globally, 32\% of the population lived in areas exceeding the WHO Level 1 Interim Target of 35 μg/m3, driven by high proportions in East (76\%) and South (26\%) Asia. The highest seasonal ozone levels were found in North and Latin America, Europe, South and East Asia, and parts of Africa. Between 1990 and 2005 a 6\% increase in global population-weighted PM2.5 and a 1\% decrease in global population-weighted ozone concentrations was apparent, highlighted by increased concentrations in East, South, and Southeast Asia and decreases in North America and Europe. Combined with spatially resolved population distributions, these estimates expand the evaluation of the global health burden associated with outdoor air pollution.},

  abstract = {The United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s SPECIATE database contains speciated particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions profiles. Emissions profiles from anthropogenic combustion, industry, wildfires, and agricultural sources among others are key inputs for creating chemically-resolved emissions inventories for air quality modeling. While the database and its use for air quality modeling are routinely updated and evaluated, this work sets out to systematically prioritize future improvements and communicate speciation data needs to the research community. We first identify the most prominent profiles (PM and VOC) used in the EPA's 2014 emissions modeling platform based on PM mass and VOC mass and reactivity. It is important to note that the on-road profiles were excluded from this analysis since speciation for these profiles is computed internally in the MOVES model. We then investigate these profiles further for quality and to determine whether they were being appropriately matched to source types while also considering regional variability of speciated pollutants. We then applied a quantitative needs assessment ranking system which rates the profile based on age, appropriateness (i.e. is the profile being used appropriately), prevalence in the EPA modeling platform and the quality of the reference. Our analysis shows that the highest ranked profiles (e.g. profile assignments with the highest priority for updates) include PM2.5 profiles for fires (prescribed, agricultural and wild) and VOC profiles for crude oil storage tanks and residential wood combustion of pine wood. Top ranked profiles may indicate either that there are problems with the currently available source testing or that current mappings of profiles to source categories within EPA's modeling platform need improvement. Through this process, we have identified 29 emissions source categories that would benefit from updated mapping. Many of these mapping mismatches are due to lack of emissions testing for appropriate source categories. In addition, we conclude that new source emissions testing would be especially beneficial for residential wood combustion, nonroad gasoline exhaust and nonroad diesel equipment.},

  abstract = {The new version of EPA's positive matrix factorization (EPA PMF) software, 5.0, includes three error estimation (EE) methods for analyzing factor analytic solutions: classical bootstrap (BS), displacement of factor elements (DISP), and bootstrap enhanced by displacement (BS-DISP). These methods capture the uncertainty of PMF analyses due to random errors and rotational ambiguity. To demonstrate the utility of the EE methods, results are presented for three data sets: (1) speciated PM2.5 data from a chemical speciation network (CSN) site in Sacramento, California (2003–2009); (2) trace metal, ammonia, and other species in water quality samples taken at an inline storage system (ISS) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (2006); and (3) an organic aerosol data set from high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) measurements in Las Vegas, Nevada (January 2008). We present an interpretation of EE diagnostics for these data sets, results from sensitivity tests of EE diagnostics using additional and fewer factors, and recommendations for reporting PMF results. BS-DISP and BS are found useful in understanding the uncertainty of factor profiles; they also suggest if the data are over-fitted by specifying too many factors. DISP diagnostics were consistently robust, indicating its use for understanding rotational uncertainty and as a first step in assessing a solution's viability. The uncertainty of each factor's identifying species is shown to be a useful gauge for evaluating multiple solutions, e.g., with a different number of factors.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Residential wood burning contributes to the total atmospheric aerosol burden; however, large uncertainties remain in the magnitude and characteristics of wood burning products. Primary emissions are influenced by a variety of parameters, including appliance type, burner wood load and wood type. In addition to directly emitted particles, previous laboratory studies have shown that oxidation of gas-phase emissions produces compounds with sufficiently low volatility to readily partition to the particles, forming considerable quantities of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, relatively little is known about wood burning SOA, and the effects of burn parameters on SOA formation and composition are yet to be determined. There is clearly a need for further study of primary and secondary wood combustion aerosols to advance our knowledge of atmospheric aerosols and their impacts on health, air quality and climate. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} For the first time, smog chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of wood loading on both primary and secondary wood combustion products. Products were characterized using a range of particle- and gas-phase instrumentation, including an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). A novel approach for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) quantification from AMS data was developed and results were compared to those from GC-MS analysis of filter samples. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Similar total particle mass emission factors were observed under high and average wood loadings; however, high fuel loadings were found to generate significantly higher contributions of PAHs to the total organic aerosol (OA) mass compared to average loadings. PAHs contributed 15 ± 4\% (mean ±2 sample standard deviations) to the total OA mass in high-load experiments, compared to 4 ± 1\% in average-load experiments. With aging, total OA concentrations increased by a factor of 3 ± 1 for high load experiments compared to 1.6 ± 0.4 for average-load experiments. In the AMS, an increase in PAH and aromatic signature ions at lower \emph{m / z} values, likely fragments from larger functionalized PAHs, was observed with aging. Filter samples also showed an increase in functionalized PAHs in the particles with aging, particularly oxidized naphthalene species. As PAHs and their oxidation products are known to have deleterious effects on health, this is a noteworthy finding to aid in the mitigation of negative wood burning impacts by improving burner operation protocols.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

PM capacity to induce oxidative stress in vivo. Thus, as-
says have been developed to quantify the oxidative poten-
tial (OP) of PM as a more refined exposure metric than PM
mass alone. Only a small number of studies have compared
different acellular OP measurements for a given set of am-
bient PM samples. Yet, fewer studies have compared differ-
ent assays over a year-long period and with detailed chemi-
cal characterization of ambient PM. In this study, we report
on seasonal variations of the dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbic
acid (AA), electron spin resonance (ESR) and the respiratory
tract lining fluid (RTLF, composed of the reduced glutathione
(GSH) and ascorbic acid (ASC)) assays over a 1-year pe-
riod in which 100 samples were analyzed. A detailed PM 10
characterization allowed univariate and multivariate regres-
sion analyses in order to obtain further insight into groups
of chemical species that drive OP measurements. Our results
show that most of the OP assays were strongly intercorrelated
over the sampling year but also these correlations differed
when considering specific sampling periods (cold vs. warm).
All acellular assays are correlated with a significant num-
ber of chemical species when considering univariate corre-
lations, especially for the DTT assay. Evidence is also pre-
sented of a seasonal contrast over the sampling period with
significantly higher OP values during winter for the DTT,
AA, GSH and ASC assays, which were assigned to biomass
burning species by the multiple linear regression models. The
ESR assay clearly differs from the other tests as it did not
show seasonal dynamics and presented weaker correlations
with other assays and chemical species.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies suggest that the main part of chronic effects from air pollution is likely to be linked with particulate matter (PM). Oxidative potential (OP) of PM is gaining strong interest as a promising health exposure metric. This study combined atmospheric detailed composition results obtained for seven different urban background environments over France to examine any possible common feature in OP seasonal variations obtained using two assays (acid ascorbic (AA) and dithiothreitol (DTT)) along a large set of samples (    N \&gt; 700    ). A remarkable homogeneity in annual cycles was observed with a higher OP activity in wintertime at all investigated sites. Univariate correlations were used to link the concentrations of some major chemical components of PM and their OP. Four PM components were identified as OP predictors: OC, EC, monosaccharides and Cu. These species are notably emitted by road transport and biomass burning, targeting main sources probably responsible for the measured OP activity. The results obtained confirm that the relationship between OP and atmospheric pollutants is assay- and location-dependent and, thus, the strong need for a standardized test, or set of tests, for further regulation purposes.},

  abstract = {Large-scale epidemiological studies have shown a close correlation between adverse human health effects and exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM). The oxidative potential (OP) of ambient PM has been implicated in inducing toxic effects associated with PM exposure. In particular, reactive oxygen species (ROS), either bound to PM or generated by particulate components in vivo, substantially contribute to the OP and therefore toxicity of PM by lowering antioxidant concentrations in the lung, which can subsequently lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and disease. Traditional methods for measuring aerosol OP are labor intensive and have poor time resolution, with significant delays between aerosol collection and ROS analysis. These methods may underestimate ROS concentrations in PM because of the potentially short lifetime of some ROS species; therefore, continuous online, highly time-resolved measurement of ROS components in PM is highly advantageous. In this work, we develop a novel online method for measuring aerosol OP based on ascorbic acid chemistry, an antioxidant prevalent in the lung, thus combining the advantages of continuous online measurement with a physiologically relevant assay. The method limit of detection is estimated for a range of atmospherically important chemical components such as Cu(II) 0.22 ± 0.03 μg m−3, Fe(II) 47.8 ± 5.5 μg m−3, Fe(III) 0.63 ± 0.05 μg m−3, and secondary organic aerosol 41.2 ± 6.9 μg m−3, demonstrating that even at this early stage of development, the online method is capable of measuring the OP of PM in polluted urban environments and smog chamber studies.},

A graphical user interface SoFi (Source Finder) was developed at PSI in order to facilitate the testing of different rotational techniques available within the ME-2 engine by providing a priori factor profiles for some or all of the expected factors. ME-2 was used to test the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, the fully constrained chemical mass balance (CMB) model, and partially constrained models utilizing a values and pulling equations. Within the set of model solutions determined to be environmentally reasonable, BBOA and SV-OOA factor mass spectra and time series showed the greatest variability. This variability represents the uncertainty in the model solution and indicates that analysis of model rotations provides a useful approach for assessing the uncertainty of bilinear source apportionment models.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Thermal-optical analysis is a conventional method for determining the carbonaceous aerosol fraction and for classifying it into organic carbon, OC, and elemental carbon, EC. Unfortunately, the different thermal evolution protocols in use can result in a wide elemental carbon-to-total carbon variation by up to a factor of five. In Europe, there is currently no standard procedure for determining the carbonaceous aerosol fraction which implies that data from different laboratories at various sites are of unknown accuracy and cannot be considered comparable. In the framework of the EU-project EUSAAR (European Supersites for Atmospheric Aerosol Research), a comprehensive study has been carried out to identify the causes of differences in the EC measured using different thermal evolution protocols; thereby the major positive and negative biases affecting thermal-optical analysis have been isolated and minimised to define an optimised protocol suitable for European aerosols. Our approach to improve the accuracy of the discrimination between OC and EC was essentially based on four goals. Firstly, charring corrections rely on faulty assumptions – e.g. pyrolytic carbon is considered to evolve completely before native EC throughout the analysis –, thus we have reduced pyrolysis to a minimum by favoring volatilisation of OC. Secondly, we have minimised the potential negative bias in EC determination due to early evolution of light absorbing carbon species at higher temperatures in the He-mode, including both native EC and combinations of native EC and pyrolytic carbon potentially with different specific attenuation cross section values. Thirdly, we have minimised the potential positive bias in EC determination resulting from the incomplete evolution of OC during the He-mode which then evolves during the He/O\textsubscript{2}-mode, potentially after the split point. Finally, we have minimised the uncertainty due to the position of the OC/EC split point on the FID response profile by introducing multiple desorption steps in the He/O\textsubscript{2}-mode. Based on different types of carbonaceous PM encountered across Europe, we have defined an optimised thermal evolution protocol, the EUSAAR\_2 protocol, as follows: step 1 in He, 200 \&deg;C for 120 s; step 2 in He 300 \&deg;C for 150 s; step 3 in He 450 \&deg;C for 180 s; step 4 in He 650 \&deg;C for 180 s. For steps 1–4 in He/O\textsubscript{2}, the conditions are 500 \&deg;C for 120 s, 550 \&deg;C for 120 s, 700 \&deg; C for 70 s, and 850 \&deg;C for 80 s, respectively.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The lower limits of the working ranges given in Table 1 are expected values based upon performance achieved in the field validation tests. Similarly the upper limits of the working ranges have been set arbitrarily based upon the maximum daily values measured during the field validation tests.

  abstract = {This European Standard describes a standard method for determining the PM10 or PM2,5 mass concentrations of suspended particulate matter in ambient air by sampling the particulate matter on filters and weighing them by means of a balance. Measurements are performed with samplers with inlet designs as specified in Annex A, operating at a nominal flow rate of 2,3 m3/h, over a nominal sampling period of 24 h. Measurement results are expressed in µg/m3, where the volume of air is the volume at ambient conditions near the inlet at the time of sampling. The range of application of this European Standard is from approximately 1 µg/m3 (i.e. the limit of detection of the standard measurement method expressed as its uncertainty) up to 150 µg/m3 for PM10 and 120 µg/m3 for PM2,5. NOTE 1 Although the European Standard is not validated for higher concentrations, its range of application could well be extended to ambient air concentrations up to circa 200 µg/m3 when using suitable filter materials (see 5.1.4). This European Standard describes procedures and gives requirements for the use of so-called sequential samplers, equipped with a filter changer, suitable for extended stand-alone operation. Sequential samplers are commonly used throughout the European Union for the measurement of concentrations in ambient air of PM10 or PM2,5. However, this European Standard does not exclude the use of single-filter samplers. This European Standard does not give procedures for the demonstration of equivalence of other sampler types, e.g. equipped with a different aerosol classifier and/or operating at different flow rates. Such procedures and requirements are given in detail in the Guide to the Demonstration of Equivalence of Ambient Air Monitoring Methods [11] and for automated continuous PM monitors (see CEN/TS 16450:2013). The present European Standard represents an evolution of earlier European Standards (EN 12341:1998 and EN 14907:2005) through the development of the 2,3 m3/h sampler to include constraints on the filter temperature during and after sampling and the ability to monitor temperatures at critical points in the sampling system. It is recommended that when equipment is procured it complies fully with the present European Standard. However, older versions of these 2,3 m3/h samplers that do not employ sheath air cooling, the ability to cool filters after sampling, or the ability to monitor temperatures at critical points in the sampling system have a special status in terms of their use as reference samplers. Historical results obtained using these samplers will remain valid. These samplers can still be used for monitoring purposes and for equivalence trials, provided that a well justified additional allowance is made to their uncertainties (see Annex B). In addition, three specific sampling systems - the -long nozzle - 2,3 m3/h sampler and the 68 m3/h sampler for PM10 in EN 12341:1998, and the 30 m3/h PM2,5 inlet in EN 14907:2005 - also have a special status in terms of their use as reference samplers. Historical results obtained using these samplers will remain valid. These samplers can still be used for monitoring purposes and for equivalence trials, provided that a well-justified additional allowance is made to their uncertainties (see Annex B). Other sampling systems, as described in Annex B of this European Standard, can be used provided that a well justified additional allowance is made to their uncertainties as derived from equivalence tests. NOTE 2 By evaluating existing data it has been shown that these samplers give results for PM10 and PM2,5 that are equivalent to those obtained by application of this European Standard. Results are shown in Annex B. This European Standard also provides guidance for the selection and testing of filters with the aim of reducing the measurement uncertainty of the results obtained when applying this European Standard.},

This European Standard describes the analytical procedures for determining EC and OC on quartz fibre filters as μg/cm2, and the subsequent calculation of concentrations as µg/m3. Sampling onto filters is to be done in accordance with EN 12341:2014 for PM2,5. The sampling process determines the size fraction of the particulate matter, the retention of semi-volatile material, and uptake/loss of volatile organic compounds on the filter at the time of sampling. The same analysis method may also be used for smaller size fractions than PM2,5. Any possible additional artefacts for larger particles, e.g. pyrolysis or higher concentrations of carbonates, should be assessed. The scope includes rural background, urban background, road side and industrial measurement sites, to allow the assessment of additional exposure of people in urban areas as stated in the objectives of the council directive and to achieve coherence in the European approach. The applicable concentration range of the proposed method is limited by the optical correction and instrument applied in the analysis of EC and OC. This method was validated from 0,2 µg CEC/cm² and 1,8 µg COC/cm² to 38 µg CEC/cm² and 49 µg COC/cm² in the laboratory and to 16 µg CEC/cm² and 45 µg COC/cm² in the field.},

  abstract = {In order to be in compliance with EU Air Quality Directive requirements, the reference methods given in the Directive 2008/50/EC [1] for the measurement of mass concentrations of particulate matter are not commonly used for operation in routine monitoring networks. These networks usually apply automated continuous measurement systems (AMS), such as those based on the use of oscillating microbalances, ß-ray attenuation, or in-situ optical methods. Such AMS are typically capable of producing 24-hour average measurement values over a measurement range up to 1 000 µg/m3 and 1-hour average measurement values up to 10 000 µg/m3, if applicable, where the volume of air is the volume at ambient conditions near the inlet at the time of sampling. The 1-hour average values may be used for: a) direct information of the public; b) aggregation to produce daily or yearly average concentration values for regulatory reporting purposes. Directive 2008/50/EC allows the use of such systems after demonstration of equivalence with the reference method, i.e. after demonstration that these systems meet the Data Quality Objectives for continuous measurements. Guidelines for the demonstration of equivalence are given in Reference [2]. This European Standard lays down the minimum performance requirements and test procedures for the type approval of appropriate AMS for particulate matter. This includes the evaluation of its equivalence with the reference method as laid down in Directive 2008/50/EC. Further, this European Standard describes minimum requirements for ongoing quality assurance – quality control (QA/QC) of AMS deployed in the field. These requirements are necessary to ensure that uncertainties of measured concentrations are kept within the required limits during extended periods of continuous monitoring in the field, and include procedures for maintenance, calibration and control checks. Additional procedures are described that determine whether an instrument’s equivalence to the reference method is maintained through possible pollution climate changes, over periods longer than five years. Lastly, this European Standard describes harmonized requirements and procedures for the treatment and validation of raw measurement data that are used for the assembly of daily or yearly average concentration values. Experience with existing methods for data treatment and validation – for similar AMS – has shown that the different ways of data treatment and validation applied may lead to significant differences in reported results for similar datasets [3]. When the European Standard is used for purposes other than measurements required by Directive 2008/50/EC, the range and uncertainty requirements may not apply. This European Standard contains information for different groups of users. Clauses 5 and 6 and Annex A contain general information about the principles of automated continuous measurement systems for particulate matter, and relevant equipment. Clause 7 and Annexes B and C are specifically directed towards test houses and laboratories that perform type-approval testing of automated continuous measurement systems for particulate matter. These clauses contain information about: c) type-approval test conditions, test procedures and test requirements; d) system performance requirements; e) evaluation of the type-approval test results; f) evaluation of the uncertainty of the measurement results of the automated continuous measurement systems for particulate matter based on the type-approval test results. Clauses 8 to 11 are aimed at monitoring networks performing the practical measurements of particulate matter in ambient air. These clauses contain information about: g) initial installation of the system in the monitoring network and acceptance testing; h) ongoing quality assurance/quality control; i) on-going verification of suitability; j) treatment, validation and reporting of measurement results.},

This European Standard describes the analytical procedures for determining anions and cations as part of the PM2,5 particulate phase, sample extraction and analysis of anions and cations by ion chromatography. Sampling onto filters will be done in accordance with EN 12341 for PM2,5. NOTE 1 Alternatively, cations, excluding ammonium, can be analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Ammonium can also be analysed by photometry or conductometry. This European Standard can be used for the measurements of anions and cations as required by Directive 2008/50/EC. The method does not take into account the possible losses during sampling due to evaporation. NOTE 2 NO3-, Cl-, NH4+ are part of the volatile fraction of PM2,5, and the concentrations determined using this standard can be used as minimum values for the concentrations of these ions in PM2,5. NO3-, NH4+, Cl- are usually up to 30 \% underestimated due to evaporational losses from the filter during sampling. This European Standard may be used at rural and urban background sites and road sites that are in accordance with the siting criteria of Directive 2008/50/EC. This European Standard is applicable to the measurement of anion/cations in PM2,5 samples corresponding to PM2,5 mass concentrations between approximately 1 μg/m3 (i.e. the limit of detection of the standard measurement method (EN 12341) expressed as its uncertainty) up to 120 μg/m3. The validated range of the anion and cation concentrations based on the field validation measurements is presented in Table 1. (...)

  abstract = {Some studies suggested a role of the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and of its oxidative potential (OP) in determining adverse health effects. Several works have focused on characterisation of source contributions to PM OP, mainly using three approaches: correlation between OP and chemical markers of specific sources; use of OP as input variable in source apportionment with receptor models; and multi-linear regression (MLR) between OP and source contributions to PM obtained from receptor models. Up to now, comparison of results obtained with different approaches on the same dataset is scarce. This work aims to perform a OP study of PM2.5 collected in an industrial site, located near a biogas production and combustion plant (in southern Italy), comparing different approaches to investigate the contributions of the different sources to OP. The PM2.5 samples were analysed for determining ions, metals, carbonaceous components, and OP activity with the DTT (dithiotreitol) assay. Results showed that OP normalised in volume (DTTV) is correlated with carbonaceous components and some ions (NO3\&minus;, and Ca2+) indicating that PM of combustion, secondary, and crustal origin could contribute to the OP activity. The source apportionment, done with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\&mdash;Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF5.0) model, identified six sources: secondary sulphate; biomass burning; industrial emissions; crustal; vehicle traffic and secondary nitrate; and sea spray. A MLR analysis between the source\&rsquo;s daily contributions and the daily DTTV values showed a reasonable agreement of the two approaches (PMF and MLR), identifying the biomass burning and the vehicle traffic and secondary nitrate as the main sources contributing to DTTV activity.},

  abstract = {Hydroxyl radical (•OH) is the most reactive, and perhaps most detrimental to health, of the reactive oxygen species. •OH production in lungs following inhalation of particulate matter (PM) can result from redox-active chemicals, including iron and copper, but the relative importance of these species is unknown. This work investigates •OH production from iron, copper, and quinones, both individually and in mixtures at atmospherically relevant concentrations. Iron, copper, and three of the four quinones (1,2-naphthoquinone, phenanthrenequinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone) produce •OH. Mixtures of copper or quinones with iron synergistically produce •OH at a rate 20−130\% higher than the sum of the rates of the individual redox-active species. We developed a regression equation from 20 mixtures to predict the rate of •OH production from the particle composition. For typical PM compositions, iron and copper account for most •OH production, whereas quinones are a minor source, although they can contribute if present at very high concentrations. This work shows that Cu contributes significantly to •OH production in ambient PM; other work has shown that Cu appears to be the primary driver of HOOH production and dithiothreitol (DTT) loss in ambient PM extracts. Taken together, these results indicate that copper appears to be the most important individual contributor to direct oxidant production from inhaled PM.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In order to identify and quantify key species associated with non-exhaust emissions and exhaust vehicular emissions, a large comprehensive dataset of particulate species has been obtained thanks to simultaneous near-road and urban background measurements coupled with detailed traffic counts and chassis dynamometer measurements of exhaust emissions of a few in-use vehicles well-represented in the French fleet. Elemental carbon, brake-wear metals (Cu, Fe, Sb, Sn, Mn), \emph{n}-alkanes (C19-C26), light-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; pyrene, fluoranthene, anthracene) and two hopanes (17\emph{α}21\emph{β}norhopane and 17\emph{α}21\emph{β}hopane) are strongly associated with the road traffic. Traffic-fleet emission factors have been determined for all of them and are consistent with most recent published equivalent data. When possible, light-duty- and heavy-duty-traffic emission factors are also determined. In the absence of significant non-combustion emissions, light-duty-traffic emissions are in good agreement with emissions from chassis dynamometer measurements. Since recent measurements in Europe including those from this study are consistent, ratios involving copper (Cu∕Fe and Cu∕Sn) could be used as brake-wear emissions tracers as long as brakes with Cu remain in use. Near the Grenoble ring road, where the traffic was largely dominated by diesel vehicles in 2011 (70\&thinsp;\%), the OC∕EC ratio estimated for traffic emissions was around 0.4. Although the use of quantitative data for source apportionment studies is not straightforward for the identified organic molecular markers, their presence seems to well-characterize fresh traffic emissions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Gasoline evaporative emissions have become an important anthropogenic source of urban atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). These emissions have a significant impact on regional air quality, especially in China where car ownership is growing rapidly. However, the contribution of evaporative emissions to secondary aerosol (SA) is not clear in an air pollution complex in which a high concentration of SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3} was present. In this study, the effects of SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3} on SA formation from unburned gasoline vapor were investigated in a 30\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{3} indoor smog chamber. It was found that an increase in SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3} concentrations (0–151 and 0–200\&thinsp;ppb, respectively) could linearly promote the formation of SA, which could be enhanced by a factor of 1.6–2.6 and 2.0–2.5, respectively. Sulfate was most sensitive to the SO\textsubscript{2} concentration, followed by organic aerosol, which was due not only to the acid catalytic effect, but was also related to the formation of organic sulfur-containing compounds. In the case of an increasing NH\textsubscript{3} concentration, ammonium nitrate increased more significantly than organic aerosol, and nitrogen-containing organics were also enhanced, as revealed by the results of positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis. New particle formation (NPF) and particle size growth were also significantly enhanced in the presence of SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3}. This work indicates that gasoline evaporative emissions will be a significant source of SA, especially in the presence of high concentrations of SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3}. Meanwhile, these emissions might also be a potential source of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing organics. Our work provides a scientific basis for the synergistic emission reduction of secondary aerosol precursors, including NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}}, SO\textsubscript{2}, NH\textsubscript{3}, and particularly VOCs, to mitigate particulate matter (PM) pollution in China.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {La combustion de la biomasse est l’une des sources majoritaires de particules atmosphériques en périodes hivernales dans les vallées alpines, et particulièrement en vallée de l’Arve où des dépassements des seuils européens sont très régulièrement observés. Ceci a conduit à la mise en place d’un large programme de remplacement des dispositifs de chauffage au bois les moins performants dans le cadre d’une des actions du Plan de Protection de l’Atmosphère, le Fond Air Bois. Le projet DECOMBIO (DÉconvolution de la contribution de la COMbustion de la BIOmasse aux PM 10 dans la vallée de l’Arve) a ainsi été mis en place en octobre 2013 afin de mesurer l’impact de cette politique de rénovation des appareils de chauffage au bois sur la qualité de l’air. C’est dans ce programme que s’inscrivent ces travaux de thèse dont l’objectif principal est de valider les méthodologies mises en place en routine pour permettre une déconvolution rapide de la combustion de la biomasse et mettre en relation les éventuels changements observés avec les avancées des remplacements de dispositifs de chauffage au bois domestiques.
Pour mener à bien ce travail, trois sites, représentant les différentes situations de la vallée de l’Arve, ont été instrumentés (Marnaz, Passy et Chamonix) afin de suivre en continu, et tout au long du projet DECOMBIO, l’évolution des concentrations atmosphériques du Black Carbon (BC) et des traceurs moléculaires permettant de distinguer la contribution de la combustion de la biomasse des autres types de combustion. Un important jeu de données a été acquis entre novembre 2013 et octobre 2014 grâce à des prélèvements réguliers sur filtre permettant une caractérisation très fine de la composition chimique des particules atmosphériques. L’utilisation de l’approche statistique « Positive Matrix Factorization » (PMF) a permis de mieux appréhender les différentes sources entrant en jeu dans les émissions de particules au sein de cette vallée avec notamment un intérêt particulier pour les émissions de la combustion de la biomasse. Le développement de cette méthodologie d’attribution et de quantification des sources de particules basé sur l’utilisation de traceurs organiques spécifiques, de contraintes particulières appliquées à ce modèle et de données de déconvolution de la matière carbonée constitue une avancée importante dans la définition des facteurs sources issus de ce modèle.
Les méthodologies développées au cours de ce travail, permettant une amélioration des connaissances et des contributions des sources, constituent donc des outils directement utilisables par les Associations Agréées de Surveillance de la Qualité de l’Air (AASQA), notamment pour l’évaluation quantitative des mesures prises pour améliorer la qualité de l’air

SSA react with acidic pollutants that lead to changes in physical and chemical properties of their surface, which in turn alter their hygroscopic and optical properties. Transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry was used to analyze morphology, composition, size, and mixing state of individual SSA at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, in summertime. Individual fresh SSA contained cubic NaCl coated by certain amounts of MgCl2 and CaSO4. Individual partially aged SSA contained irregular NaCl coated by a mixture of NaNO3, Na2SO4, Mg(NO3)2, and MgSO4. The comparison suggests the hydrophilic MgCl2 coating in fresh SSA likely intrigued the heterogeneous reactions at the beginning of SSA and acidic gases. Individual fully aged SSA normally had Na2SO4 cores and an amorphous coating of NaNO3. Elemental mappings of individual SSA particles revealed that as the particles ageing Cl gradually decreased, the C, N, O, and S content increased. 12C- mapping from nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry indicates that organic matter increased in the aged SSA compared with the fresh SSA. 12C- line scan further shows that organic matter was mainly concentrated on the aged SSA surface. These new findings indicate that this mixture of organic matter and NaNO3 on particle surfaces likely determines their hygroscopic and optical properties. These abundant SSA as reactive surfaces adsorbing inorganic and organic acidic gases can shorten acidic gas lifetime and influence the possible gaseous reactions in the Arctic atmosphere, which need to be incorporated into atmospheric chemical models in the Arctic troposphere.},

Particles were collected on Teflon filters and were analyzed for the presence of 12 quinones containing one to four aromatic rings by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Measured levels are generally greater than mass loadings reported at other locations. The mass loadings were highest during winter months and were strongly anticorrelated with temperature. ROS generation was investigated by measuring the rate of hydrogen peroxide production from the reaction of laboratory standards and ambient samples with dithiothreitol (DTT). ROS generation from ambient samples shows a strong positive correlation with the mass loadings of the three most reactive quinones and may account for all of the ROS formed in the DTT test.},

  abstract = {The causal link between ambient PM2.5 and adverse health effects is still not clear enough, nor it is clear what factors (physical and/or chemical) contribute to PM2.5 toxicity and by what mechanism(s). With a view on this, we launched the CARE experiment, during which we performed a comprehensive characterisation of the physicochemical properties of fine and ultrafine particles under exposure levels dominated by the urban combustion aerosol, and their toxicological assessment through in-vitro tests (lung epithelia cells cultured at the ALI) directly under ambient conditions, oxidative potential (determined through 2′,7′-dichlorouorescin, OPDCFH), and human biomonitoring. We already reported about aerosol characterisation, and in-vitro model results during CARE. Building upon these, in this work we assess the combustion aerosol oxidative response through the analysis of consistency between the three independent aerosol oxidative responses obtained, and the exploration of any causality link with the combustion aerosol. This is the first time to our knowledge that combustion related PM2.5 physicochemical properties and its OPDCFH are compared to the cellular-oxidative response (C-OR) obtained through the PM in-vitro test carried out (for the first time) directly under atmospheric ambient conditions, and to certain biomarkers of oxidative damage to DNA/RNA (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8 - dihydroguanosine). Our results provide a first evidence of a combustion-dependent association between the in vitro C-OR, the PM2.5 OPDCFH, and the urinary excretion of the 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine. Yet this is not a substantial basis for drawing any cause-effect relationship. However, our findings support previous literature suggesting a link between combustion and oxidative response of PM2.5. Moreover, we add a consistency across completely independent oxidative response measurements with a possible dependence on the combustion traffic-related aerosol. This is a piece of information that may have important implications in the understanding of how combustion sources contribute to oxidative response related diseases.},

  abstract = {In February 2017 the “Carbonaceous Aerosol in Rome and Environs (CARE)” experiment was carried out in downtown Rome to address the following specific questions: what is the color, size, composition, and toxicity of the carbonaceous aerosol in the Mediterranean urban background area of Rome? The motivation of this experiment is the lack of understanding of what aerosol types are responsible for the severe risks to human health posed by particulate matter (PM) pollution, and how carbonaceous aerosols influence radiative balance. Physicochemical properties of the carbonaceous aerosol were characterised, and relevant toxicological variables assessed. The aerosol characterisation includes: (i) measurements with high time resolution (min to 1–2 h) at a fixed location of black carbon (eBC), elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), particle number size distribution (0.008–10    μ   m), major non refractory PM1 components, elemental composition, wavelength-dependent optical properties, and atmospheric turbulence; (ii) 24-h measurements of PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentration, water soluble OC and brown carbon (BrC), and levoglucosan; (iii) mobile measurements of eBC and size distribution around the study area, with computational fluid dynamics modeling; (iv) characterisation of road dust emissions and their EC and OC content. The toxicological assessment includes: (i) preliminary evaluation of the potential impact of ultrafine particles on lung epithelia cells (cultured at the air liquid interface and directly exposed to particles); (ii) assessment of the oxidative stress induced by carbonaceous aerosols; (iii) assessment of particle size dependent number doses deposited in different regions of the human body; (iv) PAHs biomonitoring (from the participants into the mobile measurements). The first experimental results of the CARE experiment are presented in this paper. The objective here is to provide baseline levels of carbonaceous aerosols for Rome, and to address future research directions. First, we found that BC and EC mass concentration in Rome are larger than those measured in similar urban areas across Europe (the urban background mass concentration of eBC in Rome in winter being on average 2.6 ± 2.5    μ   g · m      − 3     , mean eBC at the peak level hour being 5.2 (95\% CI = 5.0–5.5)    μ   g · m      − 3      ). Then, we discussed significant variations of carbonaceous aerosol properties occurring with time scales of minutes, and questioned on the data averaging period used in current air quality standard for PM     10     (24-h). Third, we showed that the oxidative potential induced by aerosol depends on particle size and composition, the effects of toxicity being higher with lower mass concentrations and smaller particle size. Albeit this is a preliminary analysis, findings reinforce the need for an urgent update of existing air quality standards for PM     10     and PM      2.5      with regard to particle composition and size distribution, and data averaging period. Our results reinforce existing concerns about the toxicity of carbonaceous aerosols, support the existing evidence indicating that particle size distribution and composition may play a role in the generation of this toxicity, and remark the need to consider a shorter averaging period (\&lt;1 h) in these new standards.},

  abstract = {Particulate air pollution being recognized to be responsible for short and long term health effects, regulations for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 (PM2.5) are more and more restrictive. PM2.5 regulation is based on mass without taking into account PM2.5 composition that drives toxicity. Measurement of the oxidative potential (OP) of PM could be an additional PM indicator that would encompass the PM components involved in oxidative stress, the main mechanism of PM toxicity. We compared different methods to evaluate the intrinsic oxidative potential of PM2.5 sampled in Paris and their ability to reflect the oxidative and inflammatory response in bronchial epithelial cells used as relevant target organ cells. The dithiothreitol depletion assay, the antioxidant (ascorbic acid and glutathione) depletion assay (OPAO), the plasmid scission assay and the dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation assay used to characterize the OP of PM2.5 (10e100 mg/mL) provided positive results of different magnitude with all the PM2.5 samples used with significant correlation with different metals such as Cu and Zn as well as total polyaromatic hydrocarbons and the soluble organic fraction. The OPAO assay showed the best correlation with the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species by NCI-H292 cell line assessed by DCFH oxidation and with the expression of anti-oxidant genes (superoxide dismutase 2, heme-oxygenase-1) as well as the proinflammatory response (Interleukin 6) when exposed from 1 to 10 mg/cm2. The OPAO assay appears as the most prone to predict the biological effect driven by PM2.5 and related to oxidative stress.},

  abstract = {Rotational ambiguity in factor analyses prevents users from obtaining accurate source apportionment results. The rotational space in positive matrix factorization (PMF) can be reduced by constraining the solution with a prioriinformation such as source profiles. However, the only prior report on constraints using information on the source contributions was their use to ensure compatibility in the simultaneous analyses of PM2.5 and PM10 data. By combining data from three monitoring sites affected by a gear casting plant in Xi'an as an example, a methodology for improving the accuracy of PMF results by constraining source contributions using wind information was explored. Seven common factors derived from individual PMF analyses for each of the three sites (INDUS, URBAN, and RURAL) with different location characteristics, were then combined in a multisite PMF analysis. The factors were interpreted as nitrate with all site average contributions of 28.7\%, sulfate (22.5\%), coal combustion (19.3\%), road traffic (12.8\%), biomass burning (6.4\%), soil (5.4\%), and metallurgical industry (4.9\%). Except for the INDUS site, contributions of metallurgical industry to the URBAN and RURAL sites were pulled down maximally to reduce the rotational space. The constrained solution substantially improved the results over the base run. The local and regional nature of the sources were identified by coefficient of divergence combined with Pearson correlation analysis, and further quantitatively estimated using Lenschow approach. On average, local sources contributed for 52.4\% and 47.7\% of the PM2.5 mass concentrations at the INDUS and URBAN site respectively. The metallurgical industry showed the highest local contributions while sulfate was primarily regional. For the multisite analysis where there are considerable point source emissions, this methodology highlights the role of local wind directions to inform constraints on the results and obtaining more reliable solutions.},

  abstract = {Can mitigating only particle mass, as the existing air quality measures do, ultimately lead to reduction in ultrafine particles (UFP)? The aim of this study was to provide a broader urban perspective on the relationship between UFP, measured in terms of particle number concentration (PNC) and PM2.5 (mass concentration of particles with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5 μm) and factors that influence their concentrations. Hourly average PNC and PM2.5 were acquired from 10 cities located in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia over a 12-month period. A pairwise comparison of the mean difference and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with the application of bootstrapping were performed for each city. Diurnal and seasonal trends were obtained using a generalized additive model (GAM). The particle number to mass concentration ratios and the Pearson's correlation coefficient were calculated to elucidate the nature of the relationship between these two metrics. Results show that the annual mean concentrations ranged from 8.0 × 103 to 19.5 × 103 particles·cm−3 and from 7.0 to 65.8 μg·m−3 for PNC and PM2.5, respectively, with the data distributions generally skewed to the right, and with a wider spread for PNC. PNC showed a more distinct diurnal trend compared with PM2.5, attributed to the high contributions of UFP from vehicular emissions to PNC. The variation in both PNC and PM2.5 due to seasonality is linked to the cities' geographical location and features. Clustering the cities based on annual median concentrations of both PNC and PM2.5 demonstrated that a high PNC level does not lead to a high PM2.5, and vice versa. The particle number-to-mass ratio (in units of 109 particles·μg−1) ranged from 0.14 to 2.2, {$>$}1 for roadside sites and {$<$}1 for urban background sites with lower values for more polluted cities. The Pearson's r ranged from 0.09 to 0.64 for the log-transformed data, indicating generally poor linear correlation between PNC and PM2.5. Therefore, PNC and PM2.5 measurements are not representative of each other; and regulating PM2.5 does little to reduce PNC. This highlights the need to establish regulatory approaches and control measures to address the impacts of elevated UFP concentrations, especially in urban areas, considering their potential health risks.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Mountainous regions are often considered pristine environments; however they can be affected by pollutants emitted in more populated and industrialised areas, transported by regional winds. Based on experimental evidence, further supported by modelling tools, here we demonstrate and quantify the impact of air masses transported from the Po Valley, a European atmospheric pollution hotspot, to the northwestern Alps. This is achieved through a detailed investigation of the phenomenology of near-range (a few hundred kilometres), trans-regional transport, exploiting synergies of multi-sensor observations mainly focussed on particulate matter. The explored dataset includes vertically resolved data from atmospheric profiling techniques (automated lidar ceilometers, ALCs), vertically integrated aerosol properties from ground (sun photometer) and space, and in situ measurements (PM\textsubscript{10} and PM\textsubscript{2.5}, relevant chemical analyses, and aerosol size distribution). During the frequent advection episodes from the Po basin, all the physical quantities observed by the instrumental setup are found to significantly increase: the scattering ratio from ALC reaches values \&gt;30, aerosol optical depth (AOD) triples, surface PM\textsubscript{10} reaches concentrations \&gt;100\&thinsp;µg m\textsuperscript{−3} even in rural areas, and contributions to PM\textsubscript{10} by secondary inorganic compounds such as nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate increase up to 28\&thinsp;\%, 8\&thinsp;\%, and 17\&thinsp;\%, respectively. Results also indicate that the aerosol advected from the Po Valley is hygroscopic, smaller in size, and less light-absorbing compared to the aerosol type locally emitted in the northwestern Italian Alps. In this work, the phenomenon is exemplified through detailed analysis and discussion of three case studies, selected for their clarity and relevance within the wider dataset, the latter being fully exploited in a companion paper quantifying the impact of this phenomenology over the long-term ({$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx51"{$>$}Diémoz et al.{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx51"{$>$}2019{$<$}/a{$>$}). For the three case studies investigated, a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model (COSMO) and a Lagrangian tool (LAGRANTO) are employed to understand the meteorological mechanisms favouring transport and to demonstrate the Po Valley origin of the air masses. In addition, a chemical transport model (FARM) is used to further support the observations and to partition the contributions of local and non-local sources. Results show that the simulations are important to the understanding of the phenomenon under investigation. However, in quantitative terms, modelled PM\textsubscript{10} concentrations are 4–5 times lower than the ones retrieved from the ALC and maxima are anticipated in time by 6–7\&thinsp;h. Underestimated concentrations are likely mainly due to deficiencies in the emission inventory and to water uptake of the advected particles not fully reproduced by FARM, while timing mismatches are likely an effect of suboptimal simulation of up-valley and down-valley winds by COSMO. The advected aerosol is shown to remarkably degrade the air quality of the Alpine region, with potential negative effects on human health, climate, and ecosystems, as well as on the touristic development of the investigated area. The findings of the present study could also help design mitigation strategies at the trans-regional scale in the Po basin and suggest an observation-based approach to evaluate the outcome of their implementation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Biogenic aerosols play important roles in atmospheric chemistry physics, the biosphere, climate, and public health. Here, we show that fungi which actively discharge their spores with liquids into the air, in particular actively wet spore discharging Ascomycota (AAM) and actively wet spore discharging Basidiomycota (ABM), are a major source of primary biogenic aerosol particles and components. We present the first estimates for the global average emission rates of fungal spores. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Measurement results and budget calculations based on investigations in Amazonia (Balbina, Brazil, July 2001) indicate that the spores of AAM and ABM may account for a large proportion of coarse particulate matter in tropical rainforest regions during the wet season (0.7\&ndash;2.3 \&mu;g m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}). For the particle diameter range of 1\&ndash;10 \&mu;m, the estimated proportions are \textasciitilde 25\% during day-time, \textasciitilde 45\% at night, and \textasciitilde 35\% on average. For the sugar alcohol mannitol, the budget calculations indicate that it is suitable for use as a molecular tracer for actively wet discharged basidiospores (ABS). ABM emissions seem to account for most of the atmospheric abundance of mannitol (10\&ndash;68 ng m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}), and can explain the observed diurnal cycle (higher abundance at night). ABM emissions of hexose carbohydrates might also account for a significant proportion of glucose and fructose in air particulate matter (7\&ndash;49 ng m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}), but the literature-derived ratios are not consistent with the observed diurnal cycle (lower abundance at night). AAM emissions appear to account for a large proportion of potassium in air particulate matter over tropical rainforest regions during the wet season (17\&ndash;43 ng m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}), and they can also explain the observed diurnal cycle (higher abundance at night). The results of our investigations and budget calculations for tropical rainforest aerosols are consistent with measurements performed at other locations. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Based on the average abundance of mannitol reported for extratropical continental boundary layer air (\textasciitilde 25 ng m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}), we have also calculated a value of \textasciitilde 17 Tg yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} as a first estimate for the global average emission rate of ABS over land surfaces, which is consistent with the typically observed concentrations of ABS (\textasciitilde 10³\&ndash;10\textsuperscript{4} m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}; \textasciitilde 0.1\&ndash;1 \&mu;g m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}). The global average atmospheric abundance and emission rate of total fungal spores, including wet and dry discharged species, are estimated to be higher by a factor of about three, i.e. 1 \&mu;g m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3} and \textasciitilde 50 Tg yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}. Comparisons with estimated rates of emission and formation of other major types of organic aerosol (\textasciitilde 47 Tg yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} of anthropogenic primary organic aerosol; 12\&ndash;70 Tg yr\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} of secondary organic aerosol) indicate that emissions from fungi should be taken into account as a significant global source of organic aerosol. The effects of fungal spores and related chemical components might be particularly important in tropical regions, where both physicochemical processes in the atmosphere and biological activity at the Earth's surface are particularly intense, and where the abundance of fungal spores and related chemical compounds are typically higher than in extratropical regions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This paper is the second paper of a two-part series that uses this dataset to investigate the sources of Organic Aerosol (OA). While the first paper investigates the primary sources (El Haddad et al., 2010), this second paper focuses on the secondary fraction of the organic aerosol. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} In the context of overall OC mass balance, primary OC (POC) contributes on average for only 22\% and was dominated by vehicular emissions accounting on average for 17\% of OC. As a result, 78\% of OC mass cannot be attributed to the major primary sources and remains un-apportioned. Radiocarbon measurements suggest that more than 70\% of this fraction is of non-fossil origin, assigned predominantly to biogenic secondary organic carbon (BSOC). Therefore, contributions from three traditional BSOC precursors, isoprene, \&alpha;-pinene and \&beta;-caryophyllene, were considered. These were estimated using the ambient concentrations of Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) markers from each precursor and laboratory-derived marker mass fraction factors. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Secondary organic markers derived from isoprene photo-oxidation (ie: 2-methylglyceric acid and 2-methyltetrols) do not exhibit the same temporal trends. This variability was assigned to the influence of NO\textsubscript{x} concentration on their formation pathways and to their potential decay by further processing in the atmosphere. The influence of changes in isoprene chemistry on assessment of isoprene SOC contribution was evaluated explicitly. The results suggest a 60-fold variation between the different estimates computed using different isoprene SOC markers, implying that the available profiles do not reflect the actual isoprene SOC composition observed in Marseille. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Using the marker-based approach, the aggregate contribution from traditional BSOC was estimated at only 4.2\% of total OC and was dominated by α-pinene SOC accounting on average for 3.4\% of OC. As a result, these estimates underpredict the inexplicably high loadings of OC. This underestimation can be associated with (1) uncertainties underlying the marker-based approach, (2) presence of other SOC precursors and (3) further processing of fresh SOC, as indicated by organosulfates (RSO\textsubscript{4}H) and HUmic LIke Substances (HULIS) measurements.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Marseille, the most important port of the Mediterranean Sea, represents a challenging case study for source apportionment exercises, combining an active photochemistry and multiple emission sources, including fugitive emissions from industrial sources and shipping. This paper presents a Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) approach based on organic markers and metals to apportion the primary sources of organic aerosol in Marseille, with a special focus on industrial emissions. Overall, the CMB model accounts for the major primary anthropogenic sources including motor vehicles, biomass burning and the aggregate emissions from three industrial processes (heavy fuel oil combustion/shipping, coke production and steel manufacturing) as well as some primary biogenic emissions. This source apportionment exercise is well corroborated by \textsuperscript{14}C measurements. Primary OC estimated by the CMB accounts on average for 22\% of total OC and is dominated by the vehicular emissions that contribute on average for 17\% of OC mass concentration (vehicular PM contributes for 17\% of PM\textsubscript{2.5}). Even though industrial emissions contribute only 2.3\% of the total OC (7\% of PM\textsubscript{2.5}), they are associated with ultrafine particles (\emph{Dp}\&lt;80 nm) and high concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals such as Pb, Ni and V. On one hand, given that industrial emissions governed key primary markers, their omission would lead to substantial uncertainties in the CMB analysis performed in areas heavily impacted by such sources, hindering accurate estimation of non-industrial primary sources and secondary sources. On the other hand, being associated with bursts of submicron particles and carcinogenic and mutagenic components such as PAH, these emissions are most likely related with acute ill-health outcomes and should be regulated despite their small contributions to OC. Another important result is the fact that 78\% of OC mass cannot be attributed to the major primary sources and, thus, remains un-apportioned. We have consequently critically investigated the uncertainties underlying our CMB apportionments. While we have provided some evidence for photochemical decay of hopanes, this decay does not appear to significantly alter the CMB estimates of the total primary OC. Sampling artifacts and unaccounted primary sources also appear to marginally influence the amount of un-apportioned OC. Therefore, this significant amount of un-apportioned OC is mostly attributed to secondary organic carbon that appears to be the major component of OC during the whole period of study.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A major problem that limit the use of the model-free analysis methods, like positive matrix factorization (PMF), for the resolution of multivariate data is that usually, there is rotational ambiguity in the results. Implementing adequate constraints may reduce such ambiguities. In some special cases, non-negativity constraints may serve as a sufficient condition to uniquely resolve profiles. In this study, effect of adding new variables on the extent of rotational ambiguity is investigated, and profiles with lower rotation have been obtained on the basis of data set structure. The displacement (DISP) method of error estimation (EE) for the factor elements incorporated into the US Environmental Protection Agency's version of positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been applied to capture the uncertainty of PMF analyses due to rotational ambiguity. To explore these considerations, results are presented for synthetic including submicron particle size distributions (12–470nm) measured between January 2008 and December 2010 at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) site in Rochester, NY. Generally, added informative variables can reduce the ambiguity in the profiles. The results of the PMF analysis showed the effect of adding new variables to feasible solutions led to significantly decreased (up to 44\%) DISP intervals. More robust results with lower rotational uncertainty became possible and the results were more easily interpreted. This approach can be applied to any other field that utilize quantitative factor analysis methods.},

Size distributions of water-insoluble and water-soluble OPDTT (dithiothreitol assay, measure of oxidative potential per air volume) are reported for a roadside site and an urban site. The average waterinsoluble fractions were 23\% and 51\%, and 37\% and 39\%, for fine and coarse modes at the roadside and urban sites, respectively, measured during different periods. Water-soluble OPDTT was unimodal, peaked near 1−2.5 μm due to contributions from fine-mode organic components plus coarse-mode transition metal ions. In contrast, water-insoluble OPDTT was bimodal, with both fine and coarse modes. The main chemical components that drive both fractions appear to be the same, except that for water-insoluble OPDTT the compounds were absorbed on surfaces of soot and non-tailpipe traffic dust. They were largely externally mixed and deposited in different regions in the respiratory system, transition metal ions predominately in the upper regions and organic species, such as quinones, deeper in the lung. Although OPDTT per mass (toxicity) was highest for ultrafine particles, estimated lung deposition was mainly from accumulation and coarse particles. Contrasts in the phases of these forms of OPDTT deposited in the respiratory system may have differing health impacts.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The ability of certain components of particulate matter to induce oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species~(ROS) in vivo may be one mechanism accounting for observed linkages between ambient aerosols and adverse health outcomes. A variety of assays have been used to measure this so-called aerosol oxidative potential. We developed a semi-automated system to quantify oxidative potential of filter aqueous extracts utilizing the dithiothreitol~(DTT) assay and report here the development of a similar semi-automated system for the ascorbic acid~(AA) assay. Approximately 500~PM2.5 filter samples collected in contrasting locations in the southeastern US were analyzed for a host of aerosol species, along with AA and DTT activities. We present a detailed contrast in findings from these two assays. Water-soluble AA activity was higher in summer and fall than in winter, with highest levels near heavily trafficked highways, whereas DTT activity was higher in winter compared to summer and fall and more spatially homogeneous. AA activity was nearly exclusively correlated with water-soluble Cu (r \,=\, 0.70–0.94 at most sites), whereas DTT activity was correlated with organic and metal species. Source apportionment models, positive matrix factorization~(PMF) and a chemical mass balance method with ensemble-averaged source impact profiles~(CMB-E), suggest a strong contribution from traffic emissions and secondary processes (e.g., organic aerosol oxidation or metals mobilization by secondary acids) to both AA and DTT activities in urban Atlanta. In contrast, biomass burning was a large source for DTT activity, but insignificant for AA. AA activity was not correlated with PM2.5 mass, while DTT activity co-varied strongly with mass (r \,=\, 0.49–0.86 across sites and seasons). Various linear models were developed to estimate AA and DTT activities for the central Atlanta Jefferson Street site, based on the CMB-E sources. The models were then used to estimate daily oxidative potential at this site over the 1998–2009 period. Time series epidemiological analyses were conducted to assess daily emergency department~(ED) visits data for the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area based on the estimated 10-year backcast oxidative potential. Estimated AA activity was not statistically associated with any tested health outcome, while DTT activity was associated with ED visits for both asthma or wheeze and congestive heart failure. The findings point to the importance of both organic components and transition metals from biomass burning and mobile sources to adverse health outcomes in this region.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role in adverse health effects of atmospheric particulate matter (PM). Respiratory deposition can lead to the formation of ROS in the epithelial lining fluid due to redox reactions of PM components with lung antioxidants. As direct quantification of ROS is challenging, PM oxidative potential is more commonly measured using antioxidant surrogates including dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid, assuming that the decay of surrogates corresponds to ROS formation. However, this assumption has not yet been validated and the lack of ROS quantification in the respiratory tract causes major limitations in evaluating PM impacts on oxidative stress. By combining field measurements of size-segregated chemical composition, a human respiratory tract model, and kinetic modeling, we quantified production rates and concentrations of different types of ROS in different regions of the epithelial lining fluid by considering particle-size-dependent respiratory deposition. The extrathoracic region is found to have higher ROS concentrations compared to the bronchial and alveolar regions. Although H2O2 and O2− production is governed by Fe and Cu ions, OH radicals are mainly generated by organic compounds and Fenton-like reactions of metal ions. In winter when affected by biomass burning, model comparisons suggest that humic-like substances (HULIS) contribute to ROS formation substantially.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Sulfate formation mechanisms have been discussed extensively but are still disputed. In this work, a year-long particulate matter (PM\textsubscript{2.5}) sampling campaign was conducted together with measurements of gaseous pollutant concentrations and meteorological parameters in Beijing, China, from March 2012 to February 2013. The sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR), an indicator of secondary sulfate formation, displayed a clear summer peak and winter valley, even though no obvious seasonal variations in sulfate mass concentration were observed. A rapid rise in the SOR was found at a relative humidity (RH) threshold of ∼45\&thinsp;\% or an O\textsubscript{3} concentration threshold of ∼35\&thinsp;ppb, allowing us to first introduce the idea that RH and O\textsubscript{3} concentrations are two prerequisites for rapid sulfate formation via multiphase reactions. In the case of the RH threshold, this is consistent with current understanding of the multiphase formation of sulfate, since it relates to the semisolid-to-liquid phase transition of atmospheric aerosols. Correlation analysis between SOR and aerosol water content (AWC) further backed this up. In the case of the O\textsubscript{3} concentration threshold, this is consistent with the consumption of liquid oxidants in multiphase sulfate formation. The thresholds introduced here lead us to a better understanding of the sulfate formation mechanisms and sulfate formation variations. H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} might be the major oxidant of sulfate formation, since another liquid-phase oxidant, O\textsubscript{3}, has previously been shown to be unimportant. The seasonal variations in sulfate formation could be accounted for by variations in the RH and O\textsubscript{3} prerequisites. For example, over the year-long study, the fastest SO\textsubscript{2}-to-sulfate conversion occurred in summer, which was associated with the highest values of O\textsubscript{3} (and also H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}) concentration and RH. The SOR also displayed variations with pollution levels; i.e. the SOR increased with PM\textsubscript{2.5} in all seasons. Such variations were primarily associated with a transition from the slow gas-phase formation of sulfate to rapid multiphase reactions, since RH increased higher than its prerequisite value of around 45\&thinsp;\% as pollution evolved. In addition, the self-catalytic nature of sulfate formation (i.e. the formation of hydrophilic sulfate aerosols under high RH conditions results in an increase in aerosol water content, which results in greater particle volume for further multiphase sulfate formation) also contributed to variations among the pollution scenarios.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Observatoire P\&eacute;renne de l'Environnement (OPE) station is a rural background site located in North-Eastern France. Besides emissions from agricultural activities, the site is located far from local emissions but at an even distance from the intense emission zones of Western Germany to the north-east and the Paris area to the south-west. In the paper, we report and analyze almost six years of measurements (1 May 2012 to 31 December 2018) of the optical and physical properties of aerosol particles. Based on aerosol optical and physical measurements combined with air mass back-trajectories, we investigate the dependence of these properties on air mass type. Two distinct equivalent black carbon (EBC) sources\&mdash;origins-fossil fuel (FF) and biomass burning (BB)\&mdash; were identified. FF was the dominant source of EBC (\&gt;70\%) but showed a very marked seasonal variation. BB fraction is found higher during the cold seasons in the order of 35\% (0.1 \&micro;g m\&minus;3) against 17\% (0.05 \&micro;g m\&minus;3) during the warm seasons. The highest EBC and N0.54\&ndash;1.15 (particles whose diameter ranged from 0.54 to 1.15 \&micro;m) median concentrations were observed during the night time and during the cold seasons compared to the warmer seasons, indicating primary sources trapped within a thin boundary layer (BL). A different behavior is found for N10\&ndash;550 (particles whose diameter ranged from 10 to 550 nm) and coarse mode particles (N1.15\&ndash;4.5, i.e. particles whose diameter ranged from 1.15 to 4.5 \&micro;m) median concentrations, which were observed during the warm seasons compared to the cold seasons, indicating rather biogenic secondary sources for the smaller particles, and potentially primary biogenic sources for the coarse mode particles. The scattering and absorption coefficients and single scattering albedo (SSA) show the same seasonal variations like the ones of N0.54\&ndash;1.15 concentrations, indicating that particles larger than 500 nm seemed to contribute the most to the optical properties of the aerosol.},

  abstract = {In the paper a novel hybrid model combining air mass trajectory analysis and wavelet transformation to improve the artificial neural network (ANN) forecast accuracy of daily average concentrations of PM2.5 two days in advance is presented. The model was developed from 13 different air pollution monitoring stations in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei province (Jing-Jin-Ji area). The air mass trajectory was used to recognize distinct corridors for transport of “dirty” air and “clean” air to selected stations. With each corridor, a triangular station net was constructed based on air mass trajectories and the distances between neighboring sites. Wind speed and direction were also considered as parameters in calculating this trajectory based air pollution indicator value. Moreover, the original time series of PM2.5 concentration was decomposed by wavelet transformation into a few sub-series with lower variability. The prediction strategy applied to each of them and then summed up the individual prediction results. Daily meteorological forecast variables as well as the respective pollutant predictors were used as input to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) type of back-propagation neural network. The experimental verification of the proposed model was conducted over a period of more than one year (between September 2013 and October 2014). It is found that the trajectory based geographic model and wavelet transformation can be effective tools to improve the PM2.5 forecasting accuracy. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the hybrid model can be reduced, on the average, by up to 40 percent. Particularly, the high PM2.5 days are almost anticipated by using wavelet decomposition and the detection rate (DR) for a given alert threshold of hybrid model can reach 90\% on average. This approach shows the potential to be applied in other countries’ air quality forecasting systems.},

In spite of this fact, no study has yet been published relating to prediction of high levels of PM with diameters {$<$}10\,μm (PM10) as adjudicated by the Individual Air Quality Index (IAQI) on fugitive dust from nearby construction sites. To combat this problem, the Construction Influence Index (Ci) is introduced in this article to improve forecasting models based on three neural network models (multilayer perceptron, Elman, and support vector machine) in predicting daily PM10 IAQI one day in advance. To obtain acceptable forecasting accuracy, measured time series data were decomposed into wavelet representations and wavelet coefficients were predicted. Effectiveness of these forecasters were tested using a time series recorded between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2011, at six monitoring stations situated within the urban area of the city of Wuhan, China. Experimental trials showed that the improved models provided low root mean square error values and mean absolute error values in comparison to the original models. In addition, these improved models resulted in higher values of coefficients of determination and AHPC (the accuracy rate of high PM10 IAQI caused by nearby construction activity) compared to the original models when predicting high PM10 IAQI levels attributable to fugitive dust from nearby construction sites.},

  abstract = {Exposure to nanoparticles may pose a risk to health and this hypothesis is currently being investigated by toxicologists. Although the mechanism of nanoparticle toxicity has been shown to be mediated, in part, by oxidative stress, the precise mechanism and molecules involved are still unknown. In light of this, the evaluation of the oxidative potential of nanoparticles is an important consideration in measuring their toxicity. The aim of this study was to examine the use of a fluorogenic probe, 2 ,7 -dichlorofluorescin (DCFH), in a cell-free assay system and to assess the relationship between the results obtained with this method and with the reactive species formation observed in cells. In order to obtain a well-dispersed nanoparticle suspension, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC) addition in suspension medium was investigated. Both 1\% BSA and 0.025\% DPPC added to the medium significantly improved the stability of the nanoparticle suspension, decreasing the extent of particle agglomeration and settling over time. In a cell-free system, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by 14 nm carbon black particles (CB) suspended in DPPC was higher than that measured with the other suspensions (saline or 1\% BSA). A greater ROS production was observed in MonoMac 6 cells (MM6) following treatment with 14 nm CB suspended in medium containing BSA and/or DPPC compared to medium alone. In conclusion, 1\% BSA and 0.025\% DPPC solution was the most efficient for the preparation of a nanoparticle suspension and to measure their oxidative potential.},

This study investigated the spatial and seasonal variability of PM-induced ROS at four sites with different characteristics in Hong Kong. Cytotoxicity, exogenous and endogenous ROS was determined on a dose and time dependent analysis. Large spatial variation of ROS was observed with fine PM at urban site showing highest ROS levels while coarse PM at traffic site ranks the top. No consistent seasonal difference was observed for ROS levels among all sites. The highly heterogeneous distribution of PM-induced ROS demonstrates the differential capability of PM to produce oxidative stress, and the need to use appropriate metrics as surrogates of exposure instead of PM mass in epidemiologic studies. Several transition metals were found associated with ROS by different degree illustrating the complexity of mechanisms involved.},

  abstract = {An automated analytical system was developed for measuring the oxidative potential (OP) with the dithiothreitol 10 (DTT) assay of filter extracts that include both water-soluble and water-insoluble (solid) aerosol species. Three approaches for measuring total oxidative potential were compared. These include using methanol as the solvent with (1) and without (2) filtering the extract, followed by removing the solvent and reconstituting with water, and (3) extraction in pure water and performing the OP analysis in the extraction vial with the filter. The water extraction method (the third approach, with filter remaining in the vial) generally yielded highest DTT responses with better precision (coefficient of variation of 1–5 \%), and 15 was correlated with a greater number of other aerosol components. Because no organic solvents were used, which must be mostly eliminated prior to DTT analysis, it was the easiest to automate by modifying an automated analytical system for measuring water-soluble OP developed by Fang et al. (2015). Daily 23h filter samples were collected simultaneously at a roadside (RS) and a representative urban (GT) site for two one-month study periods, and both water-soluble (OPWS-DTT) and total (OPTotal-DTT) OP were measured. Using PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5 ������m) high-volume samplers with quartz 20 filters, the OPWS-DTT to OPTotal-DTT ratio at the urban site was 65 \% with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.71 (N=35; pvalue{$<$}0.01), compared to a ratio of 62 \% and r=0.56 (N=31; p-value{$<$}0.01) at the roadside site. Similar results were found using particle composition monitors (flow rate of 16.7 L min-1) with Teflon filters. Comparison of measurements between sites showed only slightly higher levels of both OPWS-DTT and OPTotal-DTT at the RS site, indicating both OPWS-DTT and OPTotalDTT were largely spatially homogeneous. These results are consistent with roadway emissions as sources of DTT-quantified 25 PM2.5 OP and that both soluble and insoluble aerosol components contributing to OP are largely secondary.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} An automated analytical system was developed for measuring the oxidative potential (OP) with the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay of filter extracts that include both water-soluble and water-insoluble (solid) aerosol species. Three approaches for measuring total oxidative potential were compared. These include using methanol as the solvent with (1) and without (2) filtering the extract, followed by removing the solvent and reconstituting with water, and (3) extraction in pure water and performing the OP analysis in the extraction vial with the filter. The water extraction method (the third approach, with filter remaining in the vial) generally yielded the highest DTT responses with better precision (coefficient of variation of 1\&ndash;5 \%) and was correlated with a greater number of other aerosol components. Because no organic solvents were used, which must be mostly eliminated prior to DTT analysis, it was easiest to automate by modifying an automated analytical system for measuring water-soluble OP developed by Fang et al. (2015). Therefore, the third method was applied to the field study for the determination of total OP. Daily 23 h filter samples were collected simultaneously at a roadside (RS) and a representative urban (Georgia Tech, GT) site for two 1-month study periods, and both water-soluble (OP\textsuperscript{WS-DTT}) and total (OP\textsuperscript{Total-DTT}) OP were measured. Using PM\textsubscript{2. 5} (aerodynamic diameter \&lt; 2.5 µm) high-volume samplers with quartz filters, the OP\textsuperscript{WS-DTT}-to-OP\textsuperscript{Total-DTT} ratio at the urban site was 65 \% with a correlation coefficient (\emph{r}) of 0.71 (\emph{N} = 35; \emph{p} value \&lt; 0.01), compared to a ratio of 62 \% and \emph{r} = 0. 56 (\emph{N} = 31; \emph{p} value \&lt; 0.01) at the roadside site. The same DTT analyses were performed, and similar results were found using particle composition monitors (flow rate of 16.7 L min\textsuperscript{−1}) with Teflon filters. Comparison of measurements between sites showed only slightly higher levels of both OP\textsuperscript{WS-DTT} and OP\textsuperscript{Total-DTT} at the RS site, indicating both OP\textsuperscript{WS-DTT} and OP\textsuperscript{Total-DTT} were largely spatially homogeneous. These results are consistent with roadway emissions as sources of DTT-quantified PM\textsubscript{2. 5} OP and indicate that both soluble and insoluble aerosol components contributing to OP are largely secondary.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Several studies among adult populations showed that an array of outdoor and indoor sources of particles emissions contributed to personal exposures to atmospheric particles, with tobacco smoke playing a prominent role (J. Expo. Anal. Environ. Epidemiol. 6 (1996) 57, Environ. Int. 24 (1998) 405, Arch. Environ. Health 54 (1999) 95). The Vesta study was carried out to assess the role of exposure to traffic emissions in the development of childhood asthma. In this paper, we present data on 68 children aged 8–14 years, living in the metropolitan areas of Paris (n=30), Grenoble (n=15) and Toulouse (n=23), France, who continuously carried, over 48 h, a rucksack that contained an active PM2.5 sampler. Data about home indoor sources were collected by questionnaires. In parallel, daily concentrations of PM10 in ambient air were monitored by local air quality networks. The contribution of indoor and outdoor factors to personal exposures was assessed using multiple linear regression models. Average personal exposure across all children was 23.7 μg/m3 (S.D.=19.0 μg/m3), with local means ranging from 18.2 to 29.4 μg/m3. The final model explains 36\% of the total between-subjects variance, with environmental tobacco smoke contributing for more than a third to this variability; presence of pets at home, proximity of the home to urban traffic emissions, and concomitant PM10 ambient air concentrations were the other main determinants of personal exposure.},

Results from this study revealed three types of radical decaya fast decay, slow decay, and no decayfollowing one of four decay patterns: a relatively fast decay exhibiting a 1/e lifetime of 1−21 days accompanied by a slow decay with a 1/e lifetime of 21−5028 days (47\% of samples); a single slow decay including a 1/e lifetime of 4−2083 days (24\% of samples); no decay (18\% of samples); and a relatively fast decay displaying an average 1/e lifetime of 0.25−21 days followed by no decay (11\% of samples). Phenol correlated well with the initial radical concentration and fast decay rate. Other correlations for common atmospheric pollutants (ozone, NOx, SO2, etc.) as well as meteorological conditions suggested photochemical processes impact the initial radical concentration and fast decay rate. The radical signal in PM2.5 was remarkably similar to semiquinones in cigarette smoke. Accordingly, radicals inhaled from PM2.5 were related to the radicals inhaled from smoking cigarettes, expressed as the number of equivalent cigarettes smoked. This calculated to 0.4−0.9 cigarettes per day for nonextreme air quality in the United States.},

Artificial neural network have been applied to many environmental engineering problems and have demonstrated some degree of success. The aim of study is to develop neural network air quality prediction model. In this study, a prediction method is developed using feed-forward neural network. Several parameters such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), temperature, relative humidity and air velocity are considered in this study. The performance of the developed model was assessed through a measure of Mean Square Error (MSE) and value of R2. From the constructed networks, the best prediction performance was observed in a model with network structure 7-20-4 with R2 value of 0.57 and MSE 0.062.},

(Eco)toxicity of physicochemically characterized FMP oxides for metals currently observed in the atmosphere (CdO, CuO, PbO, PbSO4, Sb2O3, and ZnO) was assessed by performing complementary in vitro tests: ecotoxicity, human bioaccessibility, cytotoxicity, and oxidative potential. Using an innovative methodology based on the combination of (eco)toxicity and physicochemical results, the following hazard classification of the particles is proposed: CdCl2 \$ CdO 4CuO 4 PbO 4ZnO4 PbSO4 4Sb2O3. Both cadmium compounds exhibited the highest threat score due to their high cytotoxicity and bioaccessible dose, whatever their solubility and speciation, suggesting that cadmium toxicity is due to its chemical form rather than its physical form. In contrast, the Sb2O3 threat score was the lowest due to particles with low specific area and solubility, with no effects except a slight oxidative stress. As FMP physicochemical properties reveal differences in specific area, crystallization systems, dissolution process, and speciation, various mechanisms may influence their biological impact. Finally, this newly developed and global approach could be widely used in various contexts of pollution by complex metal particles and may improve risk management.},

The results showed well identified temporal variations common to all the 5 sampling sites, covering a large fraction of France. During winter, concentrations of the biomass burning marker levoglucosan are significantly increased with high synchronous temporal pattern, indicating the strong impact of this source at a regional scale. During summer, concentrations of primary biogenic markers such as polyols (arabitol, mannitol) increase due to higher biological activities while oxalate contributions to OC also increases, attributed to ageing processes. The sources of primary organic aerosol are investigated using mono-tracer approaches based on these compounds. Results indicate that the relative contributions of wood burning to OC are very high, reaching an average value of 90\% during winter for some of the rural sites. Terrestrial primary biogenic organic fraction is significant in summer and fall with a monthly contribution ranging from 4.5 to 9.5\% of OC in PM2.5. A synchronous increase is also observed for secondary organic tracers (MSA, oxalic acid) during warm period confirming the influence on the large scale of these compounds that can account for 10–20\% and 5–7\% of the OC mass, respectively.},

  abstract = {The toxic effects of air pollution are widely documented. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing interest in the study of the health effects of particulate matter (PM), a previously unexplored constituent of urban air pollution. Exposure to increased levels of PM of respirable size is strongly and consistently associated with increased cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. Conversely, improved air quality appears to correlate with decreased mortality. Particulate matter is a mixture of inorganic and organic components that vary in size, origin, and composition. The mechanisms of PM health effects are still poorly understood. However, studies in cellular and animal models suggest a variety of possible mechanisms including direct effects of particle components on the intracellular sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), indirect effects due to pro-inflammatory mediators released from PM-stimulated macrophages, and neural stimulation after particle deposition in the lungs. The involvement of ROS in each one of these possible pathways is discussed.},

  abstract = {As part of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA)-Cooperative LBA Airborne Regional Experiment (CLAIRE) 2001 campaign in July 2001, separate day and nighttime aerosol samples were collected at a ground-based site in Amazonia, Brazil, in order to examine the composition and temporal variability of the natural “background” aerosol. We used a high-volume sampler to separate the aerosol into fine (aerodynamic diameter, AD {$<$} 2.5 μm) and coarse (AD {$>$} 2.5 μm) size fractions and quantified a range of organic compounds in methanolic extracts of the samples by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric technique. The carbon fraction of the compounds could account for an average of 7\% of the organic carbon (OC) in both the fine and coarse aerosol fractions. We observed the highest concentrations of sugars, sugar alcohols, and fatty acids in the coarse aerosol samples, which suggests that these compounds are associated with primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP) observed in the forest atmosphere. Of these, trehalose, mannitol, arabitol, and the fatty acids were found to be more prevalent at night, coinciding with a nocturnal increase in PBAP in the 2–10 μm size range (predominantly yeasts and other small fungal spores). In contrast, glucose, fructose, and sucrose showed persistently higher daytime concentrations, coinciding with a daytime increase in large fungal spores, fern spores, pollen grains, and, to a lesser extent, plant fragments (generally {$>$}20 μm in diameter), probably driven by lowered relative humidity and enhanced wind speeds/convective activity during the day. For the fine aerosol samples a series of dicarboxylic and hydroxyacids were detected with persistently higher daytime concentrations, suggesting that photochemical production of a secondary organic aerosol from biogenic volatile organic compounds may have made a significant contribution to the fine aerosol. Anhydrosugars (levoglucosan, mannosan, galactosan), which are specific tracers for biomass burning, were detected only at low levels in the fine aerosol samples. On the basis of the levoglucosan-to-OC emission ratio measured for biomass burning aerosol, we estimate that an average of ∼16\% of the OC in the fine aerosol was due to biomass burning during CLAIRE 2001, indicating that the major fraction was associated with biogenic particles.},

  abstract = {A fully coupled “online” Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model has been developed. The air quality component of the model is fully consistent with the meteorological component; both components use the same transport scheme (mass and scalar preserving), the same grid (horizontal and vertical components), and the same physics schemes for subgrid-scale transport. The components also use the same timestep, hence no temporal interpolation is needed. The chemistry package consists of dry deposition (“flux-resistance” method), biogenic emission as in [Simpson et al., 1995. Journal of Geophysical Research 100D, 22875–22890; Guenther et al., 1994. Atmospheric Environment 28, 1197–1210], the chemical mechanism from RADM2, a complex photolysis scheme (Madronich scheme coupled with hydrometeors), and a state of the art aerosol module (MADE/SORGAM aerosol parameterization). The WRF/Chem model is statistically evaluated and compared to MM5/Chem and to detailed photochemical data collected during the summer 2002 NEAQS field study. It is shown that the WRF/Chem model is statistically better skilled in forecasting O3 than MM5/Chem, with no appreciable differences between models in terms of bias with the observations. Furthermore, the WRF/Chem model consistently exhibits better skill at forecasting the O3 precursors CO and NOy at all of the surface sites. However, the WRF/Chem model biases of these precursors and of other gas-phase species are persistently higher than for MM5/Chem, and are most often biased high compared to observations. Finally, we show that the impact of other basic model assumptions on these same statistics can be much larger than the differences caused by model differences. An example showing the sensitivity of various statistical measures with respect to the treatment of biogenic volatile organic compounds emissions illustrates this impact.},

Here, we combine two square grids into an inherently closed structure that really maps the complete surface of the comet. Beyond that, the closed map is topologically equivalent to the Peirce quincuncial projection of the world, which enables the definition of generalized longitudes and latitudes.
Results. While the generalized version of any map projection does not exactly share the properties of the original, like preservation of area or shape, it behaves very similar. In particular, the generalized version of the quincuncial projection behaves very well over most of the surface area and shares with its original the tessellation properties.
Conclusions. The Quincuncial Adaptive Closed Kohonen (QuACK) map and the concept of generalized longitudes and latitudes provide means for global maps of arbitrarily irregular shapes.},

  abstract = {Traffic-related sources have been recognized as a significant contributor of particulate matter particularly within major cities. Exhaust and non-exhaust traffic-related sources are estimated to contribute almost equally to traffic-related PM10 emissions. Non-exhaust particles can be generated either from non-exhaust sources such as brake, tyre, clutch and road surface wear or already exist in the form of deposited material at the roadside and become resuspended due to traffic-induced turbulence. Among non-exhaust sources, brake wear can be a significant particulate matter (PM) contributor, particularly within areas with high traffic density and braking frequency. Studies mention that in urban environments, brake wear can contribute up to 55\&nbsp;\% by mass to total non-exhaust traffic-related PM10 emissions and up to 21\&nbsp;\% by mass to total traffic-related PM10 emissions, while in freeways, this contribution is lower due to lower braking frequency. As exhaust emissions control become stricter, relative contributions of non-exhaust sources—and therefore brake wear—to traffic-related emissions will become more significant and will raise discussions on possible regulatory needs. The aim of the present literature review study is to present the state-of-the-art of the different aspects regarding PM resulting from brake wear and provide all the necessary information in terms of importance, physicochemical characteristics, emission factors and possible health effects.},

We aimed to evaluate the spatial variability of the OP of measured PM2.5 using ascorbate (AA) and (reduced) glutathione (GSH), and develop land use regression (LUR) models to explain this spatial variability. We estimated annual average values (m−3) of OPAA and OPGSH for five areas (Basel, CH; Catalonia, ES; London-Oxford, UK (no OPGSH); the Netherlands; and Turin, IT) using PM2.5 filters. OPAA and OPGSH LUR models were developed using all monitoring sites, separately for each area and combined-areas. The same variables were then used in repeated sub-sampling of monitoring sites to test sensitivity of variable selection; new variables were offered where variables were excluded (p {$>$} .1). On average, measurements of OPAA and OPGSH were moderately correlated (maximum Pearson's maximum Pearson's R = = .7) with PM2.5 and other metrics (PM2.5absorbance, NO2, Cu, Fe). HOV (hold-out validation) R2 for OPAA models was .21, .58, .45, .53, and .13 for Basel, Catalonia, London-Oxford, the Netherlands and Turin respectively. For OPGSH, the only model achieving at least moderate performance was for the Netherlands (R2 = .31). Combined models for OPAA and OPGSH were largely explained by study area with weak local predictors of intra-area contrasts; we therefore do not endorse them for use in epidemiologic studies. Given the moderate correlation of OPAA with other pollutants, the three reasonably performing LUR models for OPAA could be used independently of other pollutant metrics in epidemiological studies.},

Se(IV) was successfully removed from contaminated agricultural drainage waters (California, U.S.A.) using a batch photoreactor system Se. Photochemical alkylation may thus offer a promising means of converting toxic selenium salts, present in contaminated water, to less toxic dimethylselenide.

However, urban PM is affected by local primary emissions, transport, and secondary formation; therefore, advanced methods are needed to elucidate the complex sources and transport patterns. Here, an improved source apportionment method was developed by incorporating the receptor model, Lagrangian simulation, and emissions inventories to quantify PM2.5 sources for an industrial city in China. PM2.5 data including ions, metals, organic carbon, and elemental carbon were obtained by analyzing 1~year of sampling results at urban and rural sites. This method identified coal combustion (30.64\%), fugitive dust (13.25\%), and vehicles (12.51\%) as major primary sources. Secondary sources, including sulfate, nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols also contributed strongly (25.28\%–30.76\% in total) over urban and rural areas. Hebei Province was the major regional source contributor (43.05\%–57.51\%) except for fugitive dust, on which Inner Mongolia had a greater impact (43.51\%). The megacities of Beijing and Tianjin exerted strong regional impacts on the secondary nitrate and secondary organic aerosols factors, contributing 11.32\% and 15.65\%, respectively. Pollution events were driven largely by secondary inorganic aerosols, highlighting the importance of reducing precursor emissions at the regional scale, particularly in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. Overall, our results demonstrate that this novel method offers good flexibility and efficiency for quantifying PM2.5 sources and regional contributions, and that it can be extended to other cities.},

  abstract = {Several cell-free assays are currently used to quantify and detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS). All of them have certain limitations, do not provide direct comparison of results and, to date, none of these assays have been acknowledged as the most suitable acellular assay and none has yet been adopted for investigation of potential PM toxicity. These assays include DTT, ascorbic acid, DCFH-DA and PFN assays which have been used in measurements of the particles generated from various combustion sources such as diesel engine, wood smoke (or biomass burning) and cigarette smoke, as well as for outdoor measurements. All the probes use different units for expressing redox properties of PM. Also, their reactivity is being triggered by different types of ROS. This limits the direct comparison of the results that are reporting the toxicity of the same aerosol type measured with various probes. This study is evaluating and comparing the various assays in order to develop deeper understanding of their capabilities, selectivity as well as improve understanding of the underlying chemical mechanisms.},

  abstract = {This review provides an overview of different methods to determine the oxidative potential of nanoparticles, their pros and cons and their potential applicability towards improved hazard assessment of nanoparticles.
          , 
            Materials that contain fine or nanoscale particles are already produced in large quantities and are currently re-assessed. At the same time, there is ongoing development of new and innovative nanoparticles (NPs). Risk assessment strategies for NPs are of key importance, as their impact on ecosystems and humans is still not fully understood. However, in view of the increasing variety of NPs on the market, the testing of each individual material is too time-consuming and costly. A grouping of NPs based on their intrinsic properties of concern for possible toxicological effects would be a major improvement for risk assessment. So far, no unifying intrinsic particle properties have been identified that can be used across all materials for the determination of the possible pathogenicity of NPs. The formation of reactive oxygen species by particles represents an intrinsic property. It is often referred to as “oxidative potential” (OP) and is considered a promising grouping metric as several studies demonstrated an association between (nano-)particle exposure, OP and toxicological effects. However, other studies contradict these findings and these discrepancies might be due to OP-independent differences in the physico-chemical properties of particles and differences in study design, as well as to the heterogeneity of existing OP measurement assays. In this paper, we discuss and compare different methods to determine the OP of particles, their pros and cons and their potential applicability towards improved hazard assessment and grouping of NPs.},

          , 
            
              Ambient particulate matter (PM10) was sampled alongside a motorway in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany, during a one-year period. In sum, 120 PM10 samples on quartz fibre filters, 60 samples at each side of the motorway, were taken during clear cross-wind direction situations,
              i.e.
              upwind (local background situation) and downwind (traffic influenced). To quantify the traffic-related oxidative potential (OP), or more precisely the hydroxyl radical (OH˙) generation potency, these samples were analysed to study their hydrogen peroxide dependent oxidant generation by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-
              N
              -oxide. In addition the PM10 mass, the chemical composition and the NO
              x
              concentrations were determined. For PM10 mass and traffic tracers like Sb, Ba, elemental and organic carbon as well as for NO
              x
              , an additional contribution to the background concentration caused by the traffic was observed (factor: 1.3–6.0). The downwind measurements showed in 72\% of cases higher OH˙ generation potencies with an average factor of 1.4. Significant correlations to OH˙ were detected for Fe (
              r
              {$>$} 0.58) and Cu (
              r
              {$>$} 0.57) for the upwind and overall (upwind + downwind,
              r
              {$>$} 0.44) dataset. At the downwind side these correlations were absent and are assumed to be covered by the interferences with additional soot particles leading to a quenching of OH˙. Accordingly, no significant overall correlation of the OH˙ generation potency with the traffic intensity was detected. The suggested quenching effect was confirmed
              via
              standard diesel soot (SRM 2975) measurements using the EPR approach. In summary, the traffic related PM causes an intrinsic OH˙ generation
              via
              Fenton-like reaction but obviously also leads to interferences and scavenging by traffic related carbonaceous compounds. In consequence, for future studies that would link the intrinsic OP and adverse health effects we suggest to analyse the relationship to EC/OC and to use in parallel also a further OP detection method.},

  abstract = {During the past years, actions implemented for the reduction of particulate matter emissions have in many European countries focused on road traffic emissions. Much less attention was paid to emissions from domestic wood combustion though the importance of residential wood burning as a source of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) in the Alpine region has been shown in many studies. Here we review the current knowledge about the contribution of wood burning emissions to ambient concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and PM in the Alpine region. The published results obtained by different approaches (e.g. macro-tracer method, multivariate receptor modeling, chemical mass balance modelling, and so-called Aethalometer modeling) are used in an ambient mono-tracer approach to estimate representative relationships between wood burning tracers (levoglucosan and mannosan) and EC, OC and PM from wood burning. The relationships found are applied to available ambient measurements of levoglucosan and mannosan at Alpine sites for estimation of the contributions of wood burning emissions to average levels of carbonaceous aerosols and PM at these sites. Our results imply that PM from wood burning alone adds often up to 50\% and more of the EU daily limit value for PM10 in several alpine valleys during days in winter. Concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols in these valleys are often up to six times higher than in urban or rural sites at the foothills of the Alps.},

This study examines the anthropogenic influence on biogenic organosulfate formation at an urban site in Atlanta, Georgia (GA) in the southeastern United States (US). Organosulfates were analyzed in fine particulate matter (PM\textsubscript{2.5}) collected during August 2015 in Atlanta using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and high-resolution time-of-flight (ToF) mass spectrometry. By their MS/MS response, 32 major organosulfate species were identified, selected species were quantified, and other species were semi-quantified using surrogate standards. Organosulfates accounted for 16.5\&thinsp;\% of PM\textsubscript{2.5} organic carbon (OC). Isoprene-derived organosulfates were the most abundant, dominated by methyltetrol sulfate which accounted for 12.6\&thinsp;\% of PM\textsubscript{2.5} OC. Together, the isoprene-derived organosulfates accounted for the majority of the isoprene-derived SOA that had been previously observed in Atlanta, but had not been identified at the molecular level. Other major species included seven monoterpene-derived organosulfates, five diesel and/or biodiesel-derived organosulfates, and three new organosulfates that are also expected to derive from isoprene. Organosulfate species and concentrations in Atlanta were compared to those in a rural forested site in Centreville, Alabama (AL) during summer 2013, which were also dominated by isoprene-derived organosulfates. In Atlanta, isoprene-derived organosulfate concentrations were 2–6 times higher and accounted for twice as much OC. The greatest enhancement in concentration was observed for 2-methylglyceric acid sulfate whose formation is enhanced in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO\textsubscript{2}; NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}}) and is a tracer for isoprene high-NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} SOA. The isoprene-derived organosulfates indicated a stronger influence of NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} in Atlanta compared to Centreville. Overall, these results suggest that SOA in the southeastern US can be reduced by controlling NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} and SO\textsubscript{2} emissions from fossil fuel combustion. This study gives insights into the major organosulfate species that should be targets for future measurements in urban environments and standard development.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The principal purpose of this review is to compare the evidence of health effects associated with these different sources with a view to answering the question: Is exposure to PM from some emission sources associated with worse health outcomes than exposure to PM from other sources? Answering this question will help inform development of air pollution regulations and environmental policy that maximises health benefits. Understanding the health effects of exposure to components of PM and source-specific PM are active fields of investigation. However, the different methods that have been used in epidemiological studies, along with the differences in populations, emission sources, and ambient air pollution mixtures between studies, make the comparison of results between studies problematic. While there is some evidence that PM from traffic and coal-fired power station emissions may elicit greater health effects compared to PM from other sources, overall the evidence to date does not indicate a clear ‘hierarchy’ of harmfulness for PM from different emission sources. Further investigations of the health effects of source-specific PM with more advanced approaches to exposure modeling, measurement, and statistics, are required before changing the current public health protection approach of minimising exposure to total PM mass.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Atmospheric marine aerosol particles impact Earth's albedo and climate. These particles can be primary or secondary and come from a variety of sources, including sea salt, dissolved organic matter, volatile organic compounds, and sulfur-containing compounds. Dimethylsulfide (DMS) marine emissions contribute greatly to the global biogenic sulfur budget, and its oxidation products can contribute to aerosol mass, specifically as sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid (MSA). Further, sulfuric acid is a known nucleating compound, and MSA may be able to participate in nucleation when bases are available. As DMS emissions, and thus MSA and sulfuric acid from DMS oxidation, may have changed since pre-industrial times and may change in a warming climate, it is important to characterize and constrain the climate impacts of both species. Currently, global models that simulate aerosol size distributions include contributions of sulfate and sulfuric acid from DMS oxidation, but to our knowledge, global models typically neglect the impact of MSA on size distributions.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In this study, we use the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS (GC-TOMAS) global aerosol microphysics model to determine the impact on aerosol size distributions and subsequent aerosol radiative effects from including MSA in the size-resolved portion of the model. The effective equilibrium vapor pressure of MSA is currently uncertain, and we use the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) to build a parameterization for GC-TOMAS of MSA's effective volatility as a function of temperature, relative humidity, and available gas-phase bases, allowing MSA to condense as an ideally nonvolatile or semivolatile species or too volatile to condense. We also present two limiting cases for MSA's volatility, assuming that MSA is always ideally nonvolatile (irreversible condensation) or that MSA is always ideally semivolatile (quasi-equilibrium condensation but still irreversible condensation). We further present simulations in which MSA participates in binary and ternary nucleation with the same efficacy as sulfuric acid whenever MSA is treated as ideally nonvolatile. When using the volatility parameterization described above (both with and without nucleation), including MSA in the model changes the global annual averages at 900\&thinsp;hPa of submicron aerosol mass by 1.2\&thinsp;\%, N3 (number concentration of particles greater than 3\&thinsp;nm in diameter) by −3.9\&thinsp;\% (non-nucleating) or 112.5\&thinsp;\% (nucleating), N80 by 0.8\&thinsp;\% (non-nucleating) or 2.1\&thinsp;\% (nucleating), the cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect (AIE) by −8.6\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−2} (non-nucleating) or −26\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−2} (nucleating), and the direct radiative effect (DRE) by −15\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−2} (non-nucleating) or −14\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−2} (nucleating). The sulfate and sulfuric acid from DMS oxidation produces 4–6 times more submicron mass than MSA does, leading to an ∼10 times stronger cooling effect in the DRE. But the changes in N80 are comparable between the contributions from MSA and from DMS-derived sulfate/sulfuric acid, leading to comparable changes in the cloud-albedo AIE.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Model–measurement comparisons with the Heintzenberg et al. (2000) dataset over the Southern Ocean indicate that the default model has a missing source or sources of ultrafine particles: the cases in which MSA participates in nucleation (thus increasing ultrafine number) most closely match the Heintzenberg distributions, but we cannot conclude nucleation from MSA is the correct reason for improvement. Model–measurement comparisons with particle-phase MSA observed with a customized Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) from the ATom campaign show that cases with the MSA volatility parameterizations (both with and without nucleation) tend to fit the measurements the best (as this is the first use of MSA measurements from ATom, we provide a detailed description of these measurements and their calibration). However, no one model sensitivity case shows the best model–measurement agreement for both Heintzenberg and the ATom campaigns. As there are uncertainties in both MSA's behavior (nucleation and condensation) and the DMS emissions inventory, further studies on both fronts are needed to better constrain MSA's past, current, and future impacts upon the global aerosol size distribution and radiative forcing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {Efforts have been made to relate measured concentrations of airborne constituents to their origins for more than 50 years. During this time interval, there have been developments in the measurement technology to gather highly time-resolved, detailed chemical compositional data. Similarly, the improvements in computers have permitted a parallel development of data analysis tools that permit the extraction of information from these data. There is now a substantial capability to provide useful insights into the sources of pollutants and their atmospheric processing that can help inform air quality management options. Efforts have been made to combine receptor and chemical transport models to provide improved apportionments. Tools are available to utilize limited numbers of known profiles with the ambient data to obtain more accurate apportionments for targeted sources. In addition, tools are in place to allow more advanced models to be fitted to the data based on conceptual models of the nature of the sources and the sampling/analytical approach. Each of the approaches has its strengths and weaknesses. However, the field as a whole suffers from a lack of measurements of source emission compositions. There has not been an active effort to develop source profiles for stationary sources for a long time, and with many significant sources built in developing countries, the lack of local profiles is a serious problem in effective source apportionment. The field is now relatively mature in terms of its methods and its ability to adapt to new measurement technologies, so that we can be assured of a high likelihood of extracting the maximal information from the collected data.},

In humans, as much as 40\% of inhaled ozone can be removed in the nasal cavity where the major extracellular antioxidant has been identified as uric acid. The present study was undertaken to examine urate/oxidant interactions in human nasal lavage fluid following in vitro exposure to ozone at concentrations relevant to the U.K. Lavage fluid was collected from 8 volunteers using a modified Foley catheter which permits prolonged contact of isotonic saline with the anterior nasal cavity. Nasal lavage samples in multiwell plates were exposed to ozone at concentrations of 50, 100 and 250 ppb. Samples were removed at intervals from 15 to 240 min following exposure and assayed for uric acid depletion. Uric acid concentrations in the nasal lavage were found to fall from 8.52 (time zero) to 3.99 μM, 0.05 and 0.07 μM after 240 min at 50, 100 and 250 ppb ozone respectively. At a non-environmentally relevant ozone concentration of 1000 ppb, uric acid was completely depleted after 60 min. Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between rate of loss of urate and ozone concentration (R2 = 0.97). A novel, non-invasive technique is described to investigate antioxidant compromise and its importance in individual subjects. We conclude that uric acid in nasal lavage samples is scavenged by ozone in a dose and time dependant manner.},

The GAC-ROS, composed of a Gas and Aerosol Collector (GAC), a series of reaction and transportation systems, and a fluorescence detector, was tested for instrumental performance in laboratory. Results showed good performance with a favorable R2 value for the calibration curve (above 0.998), high penetration efficiencies of ROS (above 99.5\%), and low detection limits (gas-phase ROS: 0.16 nmol H2O2 mÀ3; particle-phase ROS: 0.12 nmol H2O2 mÀ3). Laboratorial comparison between online and offline methods for particle-bound ROS showed significant loss of ROS due to the relatively long time off-line treatment. Field observations in Beijing found that concentrations of ROS in winter time were significantly higher than those observed in spring. Only a few weak positive correlations were found between ROS and some air pollutants, which reflects the complexities of ROS generation and transformation in atmosphere. This study was the first to simultaneously obtain concentrations of gas and particle-phase ROS using an online method. Consequently, it provides a powerful tool to characterize the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and the sources of the oxidizing capacity.},

This study was designed to investigate the role of surface area and oxidative stress in the cellular effects of two chemically distinct NPs, carbon black (CB) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), on the bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE14o-). CB and TiO2 NPs were taken up by 16HBE cells in a dose-dependent manner and were localized within the endosomes or free in the cytoplasm. Oxidative stress produced inside the cell by NPs was well correlated to the BET surface area and endocytosis of NPs. Contrary to intracellular conditions only CB NPs produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) under abiotic conditions. Exposure of cells to NPs resulted in an increased granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNA expression and secretion. Inflammatory effects of NPs were dependent on the surface area and were mediated through oxidative stress as they were inhibited by catalase. It can be concluded that NP induced oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory responses are well correlated not only with the BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) surface of the individual NPs but also with the internalized amount of NPs. Differences of even few nanometers in primary particle size lead to significant changes in inflammatory and oxidative stress responses.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Online analysis with mass spectrometers produces complex data sets, consisting of mass spectra with a large number of chemical compounds (ions). Statistical dimension reduction techniques (SDRTs) are able to condense complex data sets into a more compact form while preserving the information included in the original observations. The general principle of these techniques is to investigate the underlying dependencies of the measured variables, by combining variables with similar characteristics to distinct groups, called factors or components. Currently, positive matrix factorization (PMF) is the most commonly exploited SDRT across a range of atmospheric studies, in particular for source apportionment. In this study, we used 5 different SDRTs in analysing mass spectral data from complex gas- and particle phase measurements during laboratory experiment investigating the interactions of gasoline car exhaust and \&alpha;-pinene. Specifically, we used four factor analysis techniques: principal component analysis (PCA), positive matrix factorization (PMF), exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), as well as one clustering technique, partitioning around medoids (PAM).{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}All SDRTs were able to resolve 4\&ndash;5 factors from the gas phase measurements, including an \&alpha;-pinene precursor factor, 2\&ndash;3 oxidation product factors and a background/car exhaust precursor factor. NMF and PMF provided an additional oxidation product factor, which was not found by other SDRTs. The results from EFA and PCA were similar after applying oblique rotations. For the particle phase measurements, four factors were discovered with NMF and PMF: one primary factor, a mixed LVOOA factor, and two \&alpha;-pinene SOA derived factors. PAM was not able to resolve interpretable clusters due to general limitations of clustering methods, as the high degree of fragmentation taking place in the AMS causes different compounds formed at different stages in the experiment to be detected at the same variable. However, when preliminary analysis is needed, or isomers and mixed sources are not expected, cluster analysis may be a useful tool as the results are simpler and thus easier to interpret. In the factor analysis techniques, any single ion generally contributes to multiple factors, although EFA and PCA try to minimize this spread.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Our analysis shows that different SDRTs put emphasis on different parts of the data, and with only one technique some interesting data properties may still stay undiscovered. Thus, validation of the acquired results either by comparing between different SDRTs or applying one technique multiple times (e.g. by resampling the data or giving different starting values for iterative algorithms) is important as it may protect the user from dismissing unexpected results as {$<$}q{$>$}unphysical{$<$}/q{$>$}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This study examines the effects of future anthropogenic emissions on climate, and the resulting feedback to natural emissions and air quality. Speciated sector- and region-specific 2030 emission factors were developed to produce gas and particle emission inventories that followed Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B and B1 emission trajectories. Current and future climate model simulations were run, in which anthropogenic emission changes affected climate, which fed back to natural emissions from lightning (NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, N2O, H2O2, HO2, CO), soils (dust, bacteria, NO, N2O, H2, CH4, H2S, DMS, OCS, CS2), the ocean (bacteria, sea spray, DMS, N2O, H2, CH4), vegetation (pollen, spores, isoprene, monoterpenes, methanol, other VOCs), and photosynthesis/respiration. New methods were derived to calculate lightning flash rates as a function of size-resolved collisions and other physical principles and pollen, spore, and bacteria emissions. Although the B1 scenario was ?cleaner? than the A1B scenario, global warming increased more in the B1 scenario because much A1B warming was masked by additional reflective aerosol particles. Thus neither scenario is entirely beneficial from a climate and health perspective, and the best control measure is to reduce warming gases and warming/cooling particles together. Lightning emissions declined by ?3\% in the B1 scenario and ?12\% in the A1B scenario as the number of ice crystals, thus charge-separating bounceoffs, decreased. Net primary production increased by ?2\% in both scenarios. Emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes increased by ?1\% in the A1B scenario and 4?5\% in the B1 scenario. Near-surface ozone increased by ?14\% in the A1B scenario and ?4\% in the B1 scenario, reducing ambient isoprene in the latter case. Gases from soils increased in both scenarios due to higher temperatures. Near-surface PM2.5 mass increased by ?2\% in the A1B scenario and decreased by ?2\% in the B1 scenario. The resulting 1.4\% higher aerosol optical depths (AODs) in the A1B scenario decreased ocean wind speeds and thus ocean sea spray and bacteria emissions; ?5\% lower AODs in the B1 scenario had the opposite effect.},

  abstract = {The present study attempts to explore and compare the seasonal variability in chemical composition and contributions of different sources of fine and coarse fractions of aerosols (PM2.5 and PM10) in Delhi, India from January 2013 to December 2016. The annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 131~±~79~μg~m−3 (range: 17–417~μg~m−3) and 238~±~106~μg m−3 (range: 34–537~μg~m−3), respectively. PM2.5 and PM10 samples were chemically characterized to assess their chemical components [i.e. organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water soluble inorganic ionic components (WSICs) and heavy and trace elements] and then used for estimation of enrichment factors (EFs) and applied positive matrix factorization (PMF5) model to evaluate their prominent sources on seasonal basis in Delhi. PMF identified eight major sources i.e. Secondary nitrate (SN), secondary sulphate (SS), vehicular emissions (VE), biomass burning (BB), soil dust (SD), fossil fuel combustion (FFC), sodium and magnesium salts (SMS) and industrial emissions (IE). Total carbon contributes ∼28\% to the total PM2.5 concentration and 24\% to the total PM10 concentration and followed the similar seasonality pattern. SN and SS followed opposite seasonal pattern, where SN was higher during colder seasons while SS was greater during warm seasons. The seasonal differences in VE contributions were not very striking as it prevails evidently most of year. Emissions from BB is one of the major sources in Delhi with larger contribution during winter and post monsoon seasons due to stable meteorological conditions and aggrandized biomass burning (agriculture residue burning in and around the regions; mainly Punjab and Haryana) and domestic heating during the season. Conditional Bivariate Probability Function (CBPF) plots revealed that the maximum concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were carried by north westerly winds (north-western Indo Gangetic Plains of India).},

  abstract = {The present work is the ensuing part of the study on spatial and temporal variations in chemical characteristics of ­PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter\,≤\,10 μm) over Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India. It focuses on the apportionment of ­PM10 sources with the application of different receptor models, i.e., principal component analysis with absolute principal component scores (PCA-APCS), UNMIX, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) on the same chemical species of P­ M10. The main objective of this study is to perform the comparative analysis of the models, obtained mutually validated outputs and more robust results. The average P­ M10 concentration during January 2011 to December 2011 at Delhi, Varanasi, and Kolkata were 202.3\,±\,74.3, 206.2\,±\,77.4, and 171.5\,±\,38.5 μg m−3, respectively. The results provided by the three models revealed quite similar source profile for all the sampling regions, with some disaccords in number of sources as well as their percent contributions. The PMF analysis resolved seven individual sources in Delhi [soil dust (SD), vehicular emissions (VE), secondary aerosols (SA), biomass burning (BB), sodium and magnesium salt (SMS), fossil fuel combustion, and industrial emissions (IE)], Varanasi [SD, VE, SA, BB, SMS, coal combustion, and IE], and Kolkata [secondary sulfate (Ssulf), secondary nitrate, SD, VE, BB, SMS, IE]. However, PCA-APCS and UNMIX models identified less number of sources (besides mixed type sources) than PMF for all the sampling sites. All models identified that VE, SA, BB, and SD were the dominant contributors of ­PM10 mass concentration over the IGP region of India.},

  abstract = {Introduction We evaluated associations between three a-cellular measures of the oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) and acute health effects.
Methods We exposed 31 volunteers for 5 h to ambient air pollution at five locations: an underground train station, two traffic sites, a farm and an urban background site. Each volunteer visited at least three sites. We conducted health measurements before exposure, 2 h after exposure and the next morning. We measured air pollution on site and characterised the OP of PM2.5 and PM10 using three a-cellular assays; dithiotreitol (OPDTT), electron spin resonance (OPESR) and ascorbic acid depletion (OPAA).
Results In single-pollutant models, all measures of OP were significantly associated with increases in fractional exhaled nitric oxide and increases in interleukin-6 in nasal lavage 2 h after exposure. These OP associations remained significant after adjustment for co-pollutants when only the four outdoor sites were included, but lost significance when measurements at the underground site were included. Other health end points including lung function and vascular inflammatory and coagulation parameters in blood were not consistently associated with OP.
Conclusions We found significant associations between three a-cellular measures of OP of PM and markers of airway and nasal inflammation. However, consistency of these effects in two-pollutant models depended on how measurements at the underground site were considered. Lung function and vascular inflammatory and coagulation parameters in blood were not consistently associated with OP. Our study, therefore, provides limited support for a role of OP in predicting acute health effects of PM in healthy young adults.},

Short-term epidemiological studies provide sufficient evidence of an association of daily variations in BC concentrations with short-term changes in health (all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and cardiopulmonary hospital admissions). Cohort studies provide sufficient evidence of associations of allcause and cardiopulmonary mortality with long-term average BC exposure. Studies of short-term health effects suggest that BC is a better indicator of harmful particulate substances from combustion sources (especially traffic) than undifferentiated particulate matter (PM) mass, but the evidence for the relative strength of association from long-term studies is inconclusive. The review of the results of all available toxicological studies suggested that BC may not be a major directly toxic component of fine PM, but it may operate as a universal carrier of a wide variety of chemicals of varying toxicity to the lungs, the body’s major defence cells and possibly the systemic blood circulation. A reduction in exposure to PM2.5 containing BC and other combustion-related PM material for which BC is an indirect indicator should lead to a reduction in the health effects associated with PM.},

  author = {Jedynska, Aleksandra},
  date = {2016},

  abstract = {It has been shown that human exposure to air pollution causes adverse health effects. The most used indicator of air quality is the concentration of particulate matter with diameters smaller than 2.5 or 10 µm (PM2.5, PM10, respectively). PM is a chemically complex mixture and it has been suggested that observed adverse health effects depend on PM chemical composition. Most studies of PM composition have investigated short term health effects. Recently, the ESCAPE project (www.escapeproject.eu) contributed knowledge of adverse health effects of long term exposure to PM elemental constituents. Little is known about health effects caused by long-term exposure to organic PM components. The thesis contributes to characterization of air quality by monitoring and modelling of organic components and oxidative potential. Its main goals were: - Determination of the spatial contrast of the ambient concentration of organic components (EC/OC, PAH and hopanes/steranes, levoglucosan) and oxidative potential measured with dithiothreitol assay (OP DTT) within and between ten European study areas. - Assessment of the relationship between those components with other components measured more routinely (NO2, NOx, PM2.5 mass and absorbance). - Development and evaluation of Land use Regression models of spatial variation of the measured air pollutants. Substantial spatial variability was found for all measured pollutants. EC, OC and OP DTT concentrations had similar patterns in Europe as the previously reported components: NO2, PM2.5 and PM absorbance. The highest concentrations for those pollutants were found in southern Europe. ΣPAH and levoglucosan exhibited a different trend. In southern and northern Europe ΣPAH concentrations were similar with the highest concentrations in Copenhagen, Rome and Athens. Levoglucosan concentrations (marker for wood burning) did not differ significantly between the four study areas. The contribution of wood-smoke calculated based on levoglucosan measurements to PM2.5 mass was 9 to 28\% in the cold season. Concentrations of all pollutants were higher at street locations. The highest median Street to urban background ratio was found for EC (1.62). The median S/UB ratio for ΣPAH and OC was lower (1.44 and 1.32, respectively) suggesting the importance of other sources in addition to local traffic. The correlation between PM2.5and most components was moderate on average, suggesting they provide additional information on air quality. The highest median explained variance (R2) was found for EC – 84\%. PAH and OC LUR models had moderate performance. The lowest performance was for OP DTT – 30\%. Levoglucosan models had moderate performance in all four areas, but models were non-specific as we did not have predictor variables associated with wood smoke emissions. Traffic predictors were included in most models with exception to levoglucosan model. In conclusion, substantial variability was found in spatial patterns of all investigates air pollutants both within and between European study areas. The application of this highly standardized measurement and modelling approach across different locations will contribute to a consistent assessment of air pollutant levels and potentially contribute to understanding health effects associated with them.},

  abstract = {Long-term trends (2004–2017) in the chemical composition and sources of PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5~μm in diameter) in a metropolitan area were investigated using daily integrated PM2.5 chemical speciation data and continuous air pollution measurements. Eleven source factors were identified: coal combustion characterized by secondary sulphate, secondary nitrate, summertime organic carbon (OC), regional elemental carbon (EC), biomass burning, oil combustion, primary tailpipe emissions, non-tailpipe emissions related to road dust, non-tailpipe emissions related to brake wear, metal production, and road salt. Overall, coal combustion, secondary nitrate, regional EC, and oil combustion underwent marked decreases in concentrations with large reduction rates ranging from~−8\% yr−1 to~−18\% yr−1, contributing to an overall 34\% decrease in annual PM2.5 over the past 14 years. Decreases in local tailpipe emissions (−3\% yr−1) were consistent with the reduction of traffic-related air pollutants. In contrast, non-tailpipe emissions remained constant until 2010–2011 and then increased with a range of rates of 21\% yr−1 to 27\% yr−1 from 2011 to 2016. The contribution of summertime OC increased to approximately 27\% in the summer of 2013–2016, rising to become the largest PM2.5 source driven by the reduction of regional sources. The chemical composition of PM2.5 in the urban area drastically changed from inorganic-rich to organic- and metal-rich particles during 2013–2016. The depletion of ascorbic acid was measured using filter samples collected over one year to identify PM2.5 components and sources contributing to the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5. The OP was clearly associated with trace elements (e.g., Ba, Cu, Fe). Non-tailpipe emissions related to road dust and brake wear presented high redox activity per mass of PM2.5. This work suggests that summertime OC and non-tailpipe emissions in recent years have become increasingly important. As such, policies targeting traffic-related PM2.5 should focus on these sources for maximum impact.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment of 24–hour integrated PM2.5 chemical speciation data, collected at five Canadian urban sites, Windsor, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, and Edmonton was performed using the receptor model, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). In order to determine the influences of local and regional sources, in–depth wind direction and back trajectory analyses were performed using the conditional probability function (CPF) and the potential source contribution function (PSCF). The highest PM2.5 levels were observed in Windsor followed by Toronto and Montreal. Secondary sulfate and nitrate were the major factors contributing to the PM2.5 mass, accounting for 41\% – 61\% in the five sites. These secondary factors were associated with trans–boundary emissions from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. An elemental carbon (EC)–rich factor was identified in Windsor, Toronto, and Montreal, characterized by distinct EC and organic carbon (OC) profiles. The EC–rich factor accounted for 6\% – 19\% of the total PM2.5 mass in summer and also appeared to be related to trans-boundary pollutants. The combined contributions of traffic and road dust ranged from 14\% to 19\%, with a portion of the nitrate factor also coming from vehicles. In Halifax, sea salt was the second strongest source, contributing 18\% of the PM2.5. In Edmonton, strong correlation of volatile organic compounds with the major PM2.5 factors suggested that local industrial sources were significant sources of secondary aerosol. Further, biomass burning contributed 12\% of the PM2.5 mass in Edmonton. Both local and regional sources were found to contribute at all sites. Thus, PM2.5 can be reduced at all the sites through local controls. However given the significant contribution of trans–boundary contributions to the PM2.5 mass, a substantial reduction of PM2.5 in four of the cities will also require agreements to limit the production and transport of trans–boundary pollutants.},

In particular, saccharide compounds were studied as potential tracers to track aerosols of biologically derived origin. The ambient concentration, seasonal variation, and urban/rural comparison of major saccharides and other organic compounds including normal alkanes, hopanes, and carboxylic acids were determined and analyzed relative to characterizing sources of PM2.5. Saccharides, together with other known molecular markers, were analyzed by a positive matrix factorization model and eight source factors were isolated that provide meaningful interpretation of aerosol sources. Three isolated factors were characterized by the dominance of different saccharide compounds and were attributed to wood smoke, sucrose rich bio-aerosols, and fungal spore derived bio-aerosols. It was estimated that wood smoke and primary biologically derived carbon sources contributed 22\% and 14\% to the measured ambient PM2.5 mass at San Augustine and 16\% and 5\% to the measured ambient PM2.5 mass at Dallas. The relative PM contribution from other resolved sources were also calculated.},

  abstract = {The atmospheric process dynamically changes the chemical compositions of organic aerosol (OA), thereby complicating the interpretation of its health effects. In this study, the dynamic evolution of the oxidative potential of various OA was studied, including wood combustion particles and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) generated from different hydrocarbons (i.e., gasoline, toluene, isoprene, and α-pinene). The oxidative potential of OA at different aging stages was subsequently measured by the dithiothreitol consumption (DTTm, mass normalized). We hypothesized that DTT consumptions by OA were modulated by catalytic particulate oxidizers (e.g., quinones), noncatalytic particulate oxidizers (e.g., organic hydroperoxides and peroxyacyl nitrates) and electron-deficient alkenes. The results of this study showed that the oxidative potential of OA decreased after an extended period of aging due to the decomposition of particulate oxidizers and electron-deficient alkenes. Quinones (GC-MS data) partially attributed to the DTTm of fresh wood smoke particles but rapidly dropped with aging. In biogenic SOA, organic hydroperoxides (4-nitrophenyl boronic acid assay) exclusively accounted for DTTm and decreased with aging. The DTTm of aromatic SOA, mainly comprising organic hydroperoxides and electron-deficient alkenes (FTIR data), was shortly elevated during the early atmospheric process; however, it showed a noticeable decrease (32−75\%) for a long period of aging. We concluded that fresh or moderately aged OA are more reactive to a sulfhydryl group than highly aged OA.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Source apportionment of organic aerosols (OA) is of great importance to better understand the health impact and climate effects of particulate matter air pollution. Air quality models act as potential tools to identify OA components and sources at high spatial and temporal resolution, however, they generally underestimate OA concentrations, and comparisons of their outputs with an extended set of measurements are still rare due to the lack of long-term experimental data. In this study, we addressed such challenges at the European level. Using the regional air quality model Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) and a volatility basis set (VBS) scheme which was optimized based on recent chamber experiments with wood burning and diesel vehicle emissions, and contained more source-specific sets compared to previous studies, we calculated the contribution of OA components and defined their sources over a whole-year period (2011). We modelled separately the primary and secondary OA contributions from old and new diesel and gasoline vehicles, biomass burning (mostly residential wood burning and agricultural waste burning excluding wildfires), other anthropogenic sources (mainly shipping, industry and energy production) and biogenic sources. An important feature of this study is that we evaluated the model results with measurements over a longer period than in the previous studies which strengthens our confidence in our modelled source apportionment results. Comparison against positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses of aerosol mass spectrometric measurements at nine European sites suggested that the modified VBS scheme improved the model performance for total OA as well as the OA components, including hydrocarbon-like (HOA), biomass burning (BBOA) and oxygenated components (OOA). By using the modified VBS scheme, the mean bias of OOA was reduced from \&minus;1.3\&thinsp;μg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3} to \&minus;0.4\&thinsp;μg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{\&minus;3} corresponding to a reduction of mean fractional bias from \&minus;45\&thinsp;\% to \&minus;20\&thinsp;\%. The winter OOA simulation, which was largely underestimated in previous studies, was improved by 29\&thinsp;\%\&ndash;42\&thinsp;\% among the evaluated sites compared to the default parameterization. Wood burning was the dominant OA source in winter (61\&thinsp;\%) while biogenic emissions contributed \textasciitilde 55\&thinsp;\% to OA during summer in Europe on average. In both seasons, the other anthropogenic sources comprised the second largest component (9\&thinsp;\% in winter and 19\&thinsp;\% in summer as domain average), while the average contributions of diesel and gasoline vehicles were rather small (\textasciitilde 5\&thinsp;\%) except for the metropolitan areas where the highest contribution reached 31\&thinsp;\%. The results indicate the need to improve the emission inventory to include currently missing and highly uncertain local emissions, as well as further improvement of VBS parameterization for winter biomass burning. Although this study focused on Europe, it can be applied in any other part of the globe. This study highlights the ability of long-term measurements and source apportionment modelling to validate and improve emission inventories, and identify sources not yet properly included in existing inventories.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Oxidative potential (OP) has been proposed as a useful descriptor for the ability of particulate matter (PM) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequently induce oxidative stress in biological systems, which has been recognized as one of the most important mechanisms responsible for PM toxicity. The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay is one of the most frequently used techniques to quantify OP because it is low-cost, easy-to-operate, and has high repeatability. With two thiol groups, DTT has been used as a surrogate of biological sulfurs that can be oxidized when exposed to ROS. Within the DTT measurement matrix, OP is defined as the DTT consumption rate. Often, the DTT consumption can be attributed to the presence of transition metals and quinones in PM as they can catalyze the oxidation of DTT through catalytic redox reactions. However, the DTT consumption by non-catalytic PM components has not been fully investigated. In addition, weak correlations between DTT consumption, ROS generation, and cellular responses have been observed in several studies, which also reveal the knowledge gaps between DTT-based OP measurements and their implication on health effects. In this review, we critically assessed the current challenges and limitations of DTT measurement, highlighted the understudied DTT consumption mechanisms, elaborated the necessity to understand both PM-bound and PM-induced ROS, and concluded with research needs to bridge the existing knowledge gaps.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the performance of the DTT and DCFH has been compared with the BPEAnit probe. The average concentrations of PM, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) for fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particles were determined.

The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) fraction accounted for 42 \&plusmn; 14\% and 28 \&plusmn; 9\% of organic carbon in PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The average volume normalized OP values for the three assays depended on both the sampling periods and the PM fractions. The OPBPEAnit had its peak at 2 p.m.; in the afternoon, it was three times higher compared to the morning and late afternoon values. The DCFH and BPEAnit results were correlated (r = 0.64), while there was no good agreement between the BPEAnit and the DTT (r = 0.14). The total organic content of PM does not necessarily represent oxidative capacity and it shows varying correlation with the OP. With respect to the two PM fractions studied, the OP was mostly associated with smaller particles.},

For that purpose, in situ measurements of equivalent black carbon (eBC) and CO were simultaneously conducted in a suburban and an urban background monitoring site in Athens during the 3 months of winter 2014–2015. For the deconvolution of eBC into eBC emitted from fossil fuel (BC\textsubscript{ff}) and wood burning (BC\textsubscript{wb}), a method based on the spectral dependency of the absorption of pure black carbon and brown carbon was used. Thereafter, BC\textsubscript{wb} and BC\textsubscript{ff} estimated fractions were used along with measured CO concentrations in a multiple regression analysis, in order to quantify the contribution of each one of the combustion sources to the ambient CO levels. For a comparative analysis of the results, we additionally estimated the wood burning and fossil fuel contribution to CO, calculated on the basis of their CO∕NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} emission ratios. The results indicate that during wintertime BC and CO are mainly emitted by local sources within the Athens Metropolitan Area (AMA). Fossil fuel combustion, mainly from road traffic, is found to be the major contributor to both eBC in PM\textsubscript{2.5} and CO ambient concentrations in AMA. However, wintertime wood burning makes a significant contribution to the observed eBC (of about 30\%) and CO concentrations (on average, 11 and 16\% of total CO in the suburban and urban background sites respectively). Both BC and CO from biomass burning (BC\textsubscript{wb} and CO\textsubscript{wb}, respectively) present a clear diurnal pattern, with the highest concentrations during night-time, supporting the theory of local domestic heating being their main source.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {For reducing health impacts from air pollution, it is important to know the sources contributing to human exposure. This study systematically reviewed and analysed available source apportionment studies on particulate matter (of diameter of 10 and 2.5 microns, PM10 and PM2.5) performed in cities to estimate typical shares of the sources of pollution by country and by region. A database with city source apportionment records, estimated with the use of receptor models, was also developed and available at the website of the World Health Organization. Systematic Scopus and Google searches were performed to retrieve city studies of source apportionment for particulate matter. Six source categories were defined. Country and regional averages of source apportionment were estimated based on city population weighting. A total of 419 source apportionment records from studies conducted in cities of 51 countries were used to calculate regional averages of sources of ambient particulate matter. Based on the available information, globally 25\% of urban ambient air pollution from PM2.5 is contributed by traffic, 15\% by industrial activities, 20\% by domestic fuel burning, 22\% from unspecified sources of human origin, and 18\% from natural dust and salt. The available source apportionment records exhibit, however, important heterogeneities in assessed source categories and incompleteness in certain countries/regions. Traffic is one important contributor to ambient PM in cities. To reduce air pollution in cities and the substantial disease burden it causes, solutions to sustainably reduce ambient PM from traffic, industrial activities and biomass burning should urgently be sought. However, further efforts are required to improve data availability and evaluation, and possibly to combine with other types of information in view of increasing usefulness for policy making.},

  abstract = {The emissions and the potential health effects of particulate matter (PM) were assessed from two heavy-duty trucks with and without emission control aftertreatment systems when operating on CARB ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and three different biodiesel blends. The CARB ULSD was blended with soy-based biodiesel, animal fat biodiesel, and waste cooking oil biodiesel at 50vol\%. Testing was conducted over the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) in triplicate for both trucks. The aftertreatment controls effectively decreased PM mass and number emissions, as well as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared to the uncontrolled truck. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) exhibited increases with the biodiesel blends, showing some feedstock dependency for the controlled truck. The oxidative potential of the emitted PM, measured by means of the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, showed reductions with the use of biodiesel blends relative to CARB ULSD for the uncontrolled truck. Overall, the cellular responses to the particles from each fuel were reflective of the chemical content, i.e., particles from CARB ULSD were the most reactive and exhibited the highest cellular responses.},

  abstract = {Whilst performing its normal functions the lung is required to deal with a range of toxic insults. Whether these are infectious agents, allergens or air pollutants they subject the lung to a range of direct and indirect oxidative stresses. In many instances these challenges lead to oxidative alterations of peptides and proteins within the lung. Measurement of protein oxidation products permits the degree of oxidative stress to be assessed and indicates that endogenous antioxidant defences are overwhelmed. The range of protein oxidation products observed is diverse and the nature and extent of specific oxidation products may inform us about the nature of the damaging ROS and NOS. Recently, there has been a significant shift away from the measurement of these oxidation products simply to establish the presence of oxidative stress, to a focus on identifying specific proteins sensitive to oxidation and establishing the functional consequences of these modifications. In addition the identification of specific enzyme systems to repair these oxidative modifications has lead to the belief that protein function may be regulated through these oxidation reactions. In this review we focus primarily on the soluble protein components of within the surface liquid layer in the lung and the consequence of their undue oxidation.},

  abstract = {Reactions between hydrocarbons and ozone or hydroxyl radicals lead to the formation of oxidized species, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the troposphere. ROS can be carried deep into the lungs by small aerodynamic particles where they can cause oxidative stress and cell damage. While environmental studies have focused on ROS in the gas phase and rainwater, it is also important to determine concentrations of ROS on respirable particles. Samples of PM2.5 collected over 3 h at midday on 40 days during November 2011 and September 2012 show that the particulate ROS concentration in Austin, Texas, ranged from a minimum value of 0.02 nmoles H2O2 m−3 air in December to 3.81 nmoles H2O2 m−3 air in September. Results from correlation tests and linear regression analysis on particulate ROS concentrations and environmental conditions (which included ozone and PM2.5 concentrations, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and solar radiation) indicate that ambient particulate ROS is significantly influenced by the ambient ozone concentration, temperature and incident solar radiation. Particulate ROS concentrations measured in this study were in the range reported by other studies in the US, Taiwan and Singapore. This study is one of the first to assess seasonal variations in particulate ROS concentrations and helps explain the influence of environmental conditions on particulate ROS concentrations.},

An online, semi-continuous instrument to measure fine particle (PM2.5) reactive oxygen species (ROS) was developed based on the fluorescent probe 2'7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH). Parameters that influence probe response were first characterized to develop an optimal method for use in a field instrument. The online method used a mist chamber scrubber to collect total (gas plus particle) ROS components (ROSt) alternating with gas phase ROS (ROSg) by means of an inline filter. Particle phase ROS (ROSp) was determined by the difference between ROSt and ROSg. The instrument was deployed in urban Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and at a rural site during various seasons. Concentrations from the online instrument generally agreed well with those from an intensive filter measurement of ROSp. Concentrations of the ROSp measurements made with this instrument were lower than reported in other studies, often below the instrument's average limit of detection (0.15 nmol H2O2 equivalents m−3). Mean ROSp concentrations were 0.26 nmol H2O2 equivalents m−3 at the Atlanta urban sites compared to 0.14 nmol H2O2 equivalents m−3 at the rural site.},

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate systematically the differences in SR estimates that are achieved by applying a large set of SR approaches to the same common dataset. The assessment of the spatial representativeness (SR) of air quality monitoring stations is an important subject that is linked to several highly topical areas, including risk assessment and population exposure, the design of monitoring networks, model development, model evaluation and data assimilation. Nevertheless, European regulations lack a clear definition and provisions to determine the SR of the stations. Also in the scientific literature, there is no unified agreement to address this complex problem. In order to further explore this topic and to make progress in the harmonisation of the related assessment procedures, the FAIRMODE (Forum for Air Quality Modelling in Europe) Cross-Cutting Activity group on SR organised a comprehensive intercomparison exercise (IE). The main objective of this IE was to evaluate the possible variability of spatial representativeness results obtained by applying the range of different contemporary approaches to a jointly used example case study. In order to ensure a broad participation in this exercise, a collaborative effort has been established between FAIRMODE and AQUILA (the European Network of Air Quality Reference Laboratories). As a working basis, a shared dataset has been collected among a set of monitoring, emission and modelling data from the city of Antwerp.},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is known to contribute to adverse health effects, such as asthma, cardiopulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a major component of PM2.5 and can be enhanced by atmospheric oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds in the presence of anthropogenic pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide. However, whether biogenic SOA contributes to adverse health effects remains unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of isoprene-derived epoxides and SOA for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in light of the recent recognition that atmospheric oxidation of isoprene in the presence of acidic sulfate aerosol is a major contributor to the global SOA burden. The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was used to characterize the ROS generation by the isoprene-derived epoxides, trans-b-isoprene epoxydiol (trans-b-IEPOX) and methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE), and their hydrolysis products, the 2-methyltetrol diastereomers (2-MT), 2-methylglyceric acid (2-MG), their organosulfate derivatives, as well as an isoprene-derived hydroxyhydroperoxide (ISOPOOH). In addition, ROS generation potential was evaluated for total SOA produced from photooxidation of isoprene and methacrolein (MACR) as well as from the reactive uptake of trans-bIEPOX and MAE onto acidified sulfate aerosol. The high-NOx regime, which yields 2-MG-, MAE- and MACR-derived SOA has a higher ROS generation potential than the low-NOx regime, which yields 2-MT, IEPOX- and isoprene-derived SOA. ISOPOOH has an ROS generation potential similar to 1,4naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ), suggesting a significant contribution of aerosol-phase organic peroxides to PM oxidative potential. MAE- and MACR-derived SOA show equal or greater ROS generation potential than reported in studies on diesel exhaust PM, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive investigation of the toxicity of isoprene-derived SOA.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} To design effective mitigation strategies, the origin of emissions which produce air pollutants needs to be known. Contributors to air pollutants can be emission sources, like road traffic or industry, but also be more specified to emission from one location or from a specified time. Chemistry transport models can be used to assess the origin of air pollution across a large domain. However, in traditional simulations the information on origin is lost and brute force scenario studies are performed to assess the origin. Alternatively, one can trace the origin of air pollutants throughout a simulation using a labeling approach. In this paper we document and demonstrate a newly developed labeling module for the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS which tracks the source allocation for all particulate matter components and precursor gases. Dedicated simulations confirmed that the new module functions correctly. The new module provides more accurate information about the source contributions than using a brute force approach with scenario runs as the chemical regime remains unchanged. An important advantage of the new module is the reduction of computation costs and analysis work associated with the calculations. The new module was applied to assess the origin of particulate nitrate across the Netherlands. Averaged across the Dutch territory, the main contributions to nitrate are derived from road and non-road transport as well as power plants. Overall, only one-fifth of the concentration derived from sources located inside the country. The new technology enables new research directions as improved information on pollution origin is desired for policy support as well as scientific applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Five neural network (NN) models, a linear statistical model and a deterministic modelling system (DET) were evaluated for the prediction of urban NO2 and PM10 concentrations. The model evaluation work considered the sequential hourly concentration time series of NO2 and PM10, which were measured at two stations in central Helsinki, from 1996 to 1999. The models utilised selected traffic flow and pre-processed meteorological variables as input data. An imputed concentration dataset was also created, in which the missing values were replaced, in order to obtain a harmonised database that is well suited for the inter-comparison of models. Three statistical criteria were adopted: the index of agreement (IA), the squared correlation coefficient (R2) and the fractional bias. The results obtained with various non-linear NN models show a good agreement with the measured concentration data for NO2; for instance, the annual mean of the IA values and their standard deviations range from 0.86±0.02 to 0.91±0.01. In the case of NO2, the non-linear NN models produce a range of model performance values that are slightly better than those by the DET. NN models generally perform better than the statistical linear model, for predicting both NO2 and PM10 concentrations. In the case of PM10, the model performance statistics of the NN models were not as good as those for NO2 over the entire range of models considered. However, the currently available NN models are neither applicable for predicting spatial concentration distributions in urban areas, nor for evaluating air pollution abatement scenarios for future years.},

  abstract = {To attain cleaner air, it is important that authorities make informed decisions when selecting a strategy. Concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM 2.5) are high in the Tokyo metropolitan area, even though concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 μm (PM10) have dropped dramatically since the implementation of the NOx-PM Act. Currently, monitored concentration levels continue to exceed the designated ambient air quality standard set by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment. To our knowledge, no study has investigated a cost-efficient strategy for reducing PM 2.5 concentration levels in the Tokyo metropolitan area. This is the first study to examine a proper control strategy for Japan by developing an integrated model that includes both aerosol and economic models. The simulation results show that prefectures in the Tokyo metropolitan area cannot achieve the standards by relying on their own efforts to reduce PM 2.5. That is, prefectural governments in the Tokyo metropolitan areas need to cooperate with prefectures outside of the area to improve their PM 2.5 concentration levels. Thus, we simulated policies under the assumption that emissions from other sources are reduced to levels such that the PM 2.5 concentration declines by approximately 18 μg/m3. We first simulated an efficient policy, i.e., the implementation of a pollution tax. We found that the total abatement cost to meet the air quality standard using the cost-efficient strategy is approximately 142.7 billion yen.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the redox activity of particles may represent a major determinant of their toxicity. We measured the in vitro ability of ambient fine particles [particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5)] to form hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in an oxidant environment, as well as to deplete physiologic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, glutathione) in the naturally reducing environment of the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF). The objective was to examine how these toxicologically relevant measures were related to other PM characteristics, such as total and elemental mass concentration and light absorbance. DESIGN: Gravimetric PM2.5 samples (n = 716) collected over 1 year from 20 centers participating in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were available. Light absorbance of these filters was measured with reflectometry. PM suspensions were recovered from filters by vortexing and sonication before dilution to a standard concentration. The oxidative activity of these particle suspensions was then assessed by measuring their ability to generate ·OH in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, using electron spin resonance and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide as spin trap, or by establishing their capacity to deplete antioxidants from a synthetic model of the RTLF. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: PM oxidative activity varied significantly among European sampling sites. Correlations between oxidative activity and all other characteristics of PM were low, both within centers (temporal correlation) and across communities (annual mean). Thus, no single surrogate measure of PM redox activity could be identified. Because these novel measures are suggested to reflect crucial biologic mechanisms of PM, their use may be pertinent in epidemiologic studies. Therefore, it is important to define the appropriate methods to determine oxidative activity of PM.},

In the flow reactor, SOA precursors were oxidized using OH concentrations ranging from 2.0 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{8} to 2.2 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{10} molec cm\textsuperscript{−3} over exposure times of 100 s. In the environmental chambers, precursors were oxidized using OH concentrations ranging from 2 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{6} to 2 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{7} molec cm\textsuperscript{−3} over exposure times of several hours. The OH concentration in the chamber experiments is close to that found in the atmosphere, but the integrated OH exposure in the flow reactor can simulate atmospheric exposure times of multiple days compared to chamber exposure times of only a day or so. In most cases, for a specific SOA type the most-oxidized chamber SOA and the least-oxidized flow reactor SOA have similar mass spectra, oxygen-to-carbon and hydrogen-to-carbon ratios, and carbon oxidation states at integrated OH exposures between approximately 1 × 10\textsuperscript{11} and 2 × 10\textsuperscript{11} molec cm\textsuperscript{−3} s, or about 1–2 days of equivalent atmospheric oxidation. This observation suggests that in the range of available OH exposure overlap for the flow reactor and chambers, SOA elemental composition as measured by an aerosol mass spectrometer is similar whether the precursor is exposed to low OH concentrations over long exposure times or high OH concentrations over short exposure times. This similarity in turn suggests that both in the flow reactor and in chambers, SOA chemical composition at low OH exposure is governed primarily by gas-phase OH oxidation of the precursors rather than heterogeneous oxidation of the condensed particles. In general, SOA yields measured in the flow reactor are lower than measured in chambers for the range of equivalent OH exposures that can be measured in both the flow reactor and chambers. The influence of sulfate seed particles on isoprene SOA yield measurements was examined in the flow reactor. The studies show that seed particles increase the yield of SOA produced in flow reactors by a factor of 3 to 5 and may also account in part for higher SOA yields obtained in the chambers, where seed particles are routinely used.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The detection principle relies on the amplification of the absorbance under multiple scattering conditions due to optical path lengthening [1,2]. In this study, the presence of cellulose membrane that acts as random medium into the glass optical cell considerably improved the sensitivity of the detection based on colorimetric FOX assay (FeII / orange xylenol). Despite the loss of assay volume (cellulose occupies 75\% of cell volume) the limit of detection is enhanced by one order of magnitude reaching the value of 9 nM (H2O2 equivalents). Spectral analysis is performed automatically with a periodicity of 5 to 15 s, giving rise to real-time ROS measurements. Moreover, the elution of air sample into the collection chamber via a micro-diffuser (impinger) enables quantitative determination of ROS contained in or generated from airborne samples. As proof-of-concept the photonic ROS detection system was used in the determination of both ROS generated from traffic pollution and ROS contained in the exhaled breath as lung inflammation biomarkers.},

But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

              Aims
              Long-term exposure of humans to air pollution enhances the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. A novel Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) has been derived from many cohort studies, providing much-improved coverage of the exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We applied the GEMM to assess excess mortality attributable to ambient air pollution on a global scale and compare to other risk factors.
            
            
              Methods and results
              We used a data-informed atmospheric model to calculate worldwide exposure to PM2.5 and ozone pollution, which was combined with the GEMM to estimate disease-specific excess mortality and loss of life expectancy (LLE) in 2015. Using this model, we investigated the effects of different pollution sources, distinguishing between natural (wildfires, aeolian dust) and anthropogenic emissions, including fossil fuel use. Global excess mortality from all ambient air pollution is estimated at 8.8 (7.11–10.41) million/year, with an LLE of 2.9 (2.3–3.5) years, being a factor of two higher than earlier estimates, and exceeding that of tobacco smoking. The global mean mortality rate of about 120 per 100~000 people/year is much exceeded in East Asia (196 per 100~000/year) and Europe (133 per 100~000/year). Without fossil fuel emissions, the global mean life expectancy would increase by 1.1 (0.9–1.2) years and 1.7 (1.4–2.0) years by removing all potentially controllable anthropogenic emissions. Because aeolian dust and wildfire emission control is impracticable, significant LLE is unavoidable.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Ambient air pollution is one of the main global health risks, causing significant excess mortality and LLE, especially through cardiovascular diseases. It causes an LLE that rivals that of tobacco smoking. The global mean LLE from air pollution strongly exceeds that by violence (all forms together), i.e. by an order of magnitude (LLE being 2.9 and 0.3\,years, respectively).},

Redox-active organic chemicals on the particle surface play an important role in PM adverse health effects and may determine the adjuvant effect of different particle types according to their potential to perturb redox equilibrium in the immune system.ObjectivesWe determined whether the adjuvant effect of ambient fine particles versus ultrafine particles (UFPs) is correlated to their prooxidant potential.MethodsWe have established an intranasal sensitization model that uses ambient PM as a potential adjuvant for sensitization to ovalbumin (OVA), which enhances the capacity for secondary OVA challenge to induce allergic airway inflammation.ResultsUFPs with a greater polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content and higher oxidant potential enhanced OVA sensitization more readily than did fine particles. This manifests as enhanced allergic inflammation upon secondary OVA challenge, leading to eosinophilic inflammation and mucoid hyperplasia starting at the nasal turbinates all the way down to the small pulmonary airways. The thiol antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine was able to suppress some of these sensitization events.ConclusionsThe adjuvant effects of ambient UFP is determined by their oxidant potential, which likely plays a role in changing the redox equilibrium in the mucosal immune system.},

In order to investigate the influence of this regional anthropogenic activity on molecular characteristics of organic aerosols, PM\textsubscript{2.5} filter samples were collected with a 3\&thinsp;h interval at a rural site of NCP from 10 to 25 June 2013 and analyzed for more than 100 organic tracer compounds, including both primary (\emph{n}-alkanes, fatty acids/alcohols, sugar compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, hopanes, and phthalate esters) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) tracers (phthalic acids, isoprene-, \emph{α}-/\emph{β}-pinene, \emph{β}-caryophyllene, and toluene-derived products), as well as organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). Total concentrations of the measured organics ranged from 177 to 6248\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3} (mean 1806±1308\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3}) during the study period, most of which were contributed by sugar compounds, followed by fatty acids and fatty alcohols. Levoglucosan (240±288\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3}) was the most abundant single compound and strongly correlated with OC and WSOC, suggesting that biomass burning (BB) is an important source of summertime organic aerosols in this rural region. Based on the analysis of fire spots and backward trajectories of air masses, two representative periods were classified, which are (1) Period 1 (P1), 13 June 21:00–16 June at 15:00\&thinsp;CST (China Standard Time), when air masses were uniformly distributed from the southeast part of NCP, where intensive open-field biomass burning occurred; and (2) Period 2 (P2), 22 June at 12:00 to 24 June at 06:00\&thinsp;CST, which is representative of local emission. Nearly all the measured PM components showed much higher concentrations in P1 than in P2. Although \emph{n}-alkanes, fatty acids, and fatty alcohols presented similar temporal–diurnal variations as those of levoglucosan throughout the entire period, their molecular distributions were more dominated by high molecular weight (HMW) compounds in P1, demonstrating an enhanced contribution from BB emissions. In contrast, intensive BB emission in P1 seems to have limited influence on the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes, and phthalate esters. Both 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and \emph{β}-caryophyllinic acid showed strong linearly correlations with levoglucosan (\emph{R}\textsuperscript{2}=0.72 and 0.80, respectively), indicating that BB is also an important source for terpene-derived SOA formation. A tracer-based method was used to estimate the distributions of biomass-burning OC, fungal-spore OC, and secondary organic carbon (SOC) derived from isoprene, \emph{α}-/\emph{β}-pinene, \emph{β}-caryophyllene, and toluene in the different periods. The results showed that the contribution of biomass-burning OC to total OC in P1 (27.6\&thinsp;\%) was 1.7 times that in P2 (17.1\&thinsp;\%). However, the contribution of SOC from oxidation of the four kinds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increased slightly from 16.3\&thinsp;\% in P1 to 21.1\&thinsp;\% in P2.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {HUmic-LIke Substances (HULIS) comprise a significant fraction of the water-soluble organic aerosol mass and influence the water uptake properties of aerosols in the atmosphere. In this work, the abundance and size distributions of HULIS in ambient aerosols were measured in a rural location in South China at a time with a visible presence of crop residue burning. PM2.5 samples of fresh smoke from burning rice straw and sugar cane leaves were also collected and analyzed for HULIS and major aerosol constituents. HULIS were abundant in both ambient samples and in fresh biomass burning emissions, accounting for ∼60\% of the water-soluble organic carbon in the ambient aerosols and ∼30\% in the fresh biomass burning aerosols. In the particles in the range of 0.32–1.8μm, the abundance of HULIS was 40–90\% of the combined abundance of sulfate and ammonium, suggesting that HULIS should be considered when quantifying the role of sulfate aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei. The size distribution of HULIS was characterized by a dominant droplet mode with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) in the range of 0.63–0.87μm, accounting for 81\% of the total HULIS mass, a minor condensation mode (12\%, MMAD: 0.23–0.28μm) and a coarse mode (7\%, MMAD: 4.0–5.7μm). The small amount of HULIS in the coarse mode indicated that soil-derived HULIS was a very minor source. On the basis of the size distribution characteristics, HULIS were postulated to have multiple sources, including secondary formation in cloud droplets, secondary formation through heterogeneous reactions or aerosol-phase reactions, and primary emissions from biomass burning.},

The underlying toxicological mechanisms are of great scientific interest. A hypothesis under investigation is that many of the adverse health effects may derive from oxidative stress, initiated by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within affected cells. In this study, the main objective was to determine whether aged-diesel exhaust PM has a higher oxidant generation and toxicity than fresh diesel exhaust PM. The diesel exhaust PM was generated from a 1980 Mercedes-Benz model 300SD, and a dual 270m3 Teflon film chamber was utilized to generate two test atmospheres. One side of the chamber is used to produce ozone–diesel exhaust PM system, and another side of the chamber was used to produce diesel exhaust PM only system. A newly optimized dithiothreitol (DTT) method was used to assess their oxidant generation and toxicity. The results of this study showed: (1) both fresh and aged-diesel exhaust PM had high oxidant generation and toxicity; (2) ozone–diesel exhaust PM had a higher toxicity response than diesel exhaust PM only; (3) the diesel exhaust PM toxicity increased with time; (4) the optimized DTT method could be used as a good quantitative chemical assay for oxidant generation and toxicity measurement.},

The contents of oxygen-containing functional groups, hydrophilicity, water-soluble organic compounds, and free radicals increased after ozone treatment. The redox capacity and cytotoxicity of BC particles were enhanced by ozone oxidation as detected by dithiothreitol (DTT) and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide assays. The redox activities of different BC particles are compared. Particle phase contributed significantly to total redox activity as detected by the DTT assay. Results indicate that BC particles that have undergone aging in the atmosphere may be more toxic and harmful to human health.},

The premise for this study is the increasing awareness that various PM components induce pulmonary inflammation through the generation of oxidative stress. Coarse, fine, and ultrafine particles (UFPs) were collected by ambient particle concentrators in the Los Angeles basin in California and used to study their chemical composition in parallel with assays for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ability to induce oxidative stress in macrophages and epithelial cells. UFPs were most potent toward inducing cellular heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and depleting intracellular glutathione. HO-1 expression, a sensitive marker for oxidative stress, is directly correlated with the high organic carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of UFPs. The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, a quantitative measure of in vitro ROS formation, was correlated with PAH content and HO-1 expression. UFPs also had the highest ROS activity in the DTT assay. Because the small size of UFPs allows better tissue penetration, we used electron microscopy to study subcellular localization. UFPs and, to a lesser extent, fine particles, localize in mitochondria, where they induce major structural damage. This may contribute to oxidative stress. Our studies demonstrate that the increased biological potency of UFPs is related to the content of redox cycling organic chemicals and their ability to damage mitochondria.},

  abstract = {Environmental context Volatile selenium compounds from the oceans may ultimately be an important selenium source for agricultural soils. It has been hypothesised that marine algae are responsible for volatile selenium emissions, but in laboratory experiments, we observed minimal volatile selenium production by two marine algae known to produce large amounts of volatile sulfur. Instead, we found hints that bacterial processes may be important in the production of volatile selenium in the oceans. Abstract Volatile methylated selenium compounds, especially dimethylselenide, are thought to comprise the majority of marine selenium emissions. Despite their potential importance for the global redistribution of this trace element, which is essential for human health, little is known about the algal production of volatile organic selenium compounds. Previous studies have found correlations between dissolved dimethylselenide concentrations, dimethylsulfide concentrations (the sulfur analogue of dimethylselenide) and proxies for algal activity, most notably during a bloom of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi. In culturing studies, we investigated the ability of three globally important marine algal species, E. huxleyi, Phaeocystis globosa and the diatom Thalassiosira oceanica, to produce dimethylselenide. Despite substantial uptake of selenium and the production of volatile sulfur, E. huxleyi and T. oceanica produced negligible volatile selenium ({$<$}2nM). P. globosa produced low amounts of volatile selenium (\textasciitilde 8nM), but grew poorly in our laboratory. However, cultures of marine bacteria and mixed bacterial–algal cultures showed that substantial amounts of volatile selenium can be produced in the presence of marine bacteria. In addition, a culture of marine bacteria alone produced \textasciitilde 50nM volatile selenium, far more than axenic cultures of E. huxleyi when exposed to equivalent selenite concentrations. Our results hint that marine algae may be of minor importance in the direct production of volatile selenium in the oceans, and suggest that the production of these compounds in the marine biosphere may instead be controlled by bacterial activity.},

  abstract = {In humans, studies based on Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept and targeting short half-lived chemicals, including many endocrine disruptors, generally assessed exposures from spot biospecimens. Effects of early-life exposure to atmospheric pollutants were reported, based on outdoor air pollution levels. For both exposure families, exposure misclassification is expected from these designs: for non-persistent chemicals, because a spot biospecimen is unlikely to capture exposure over windows longer than a few days; for air pollutants, because indoor levels are ignored. We developed a couple-child cohort relying on deep phenotyping and extended personal exposure assessment aiming to better characterize the effects of components of the exposome, including air pollutants and non-persistent endocrine disruptors, on child health and development. Pregnant women were included in SEPAGES couple-child cohort (Grenoble area) from 2014 to 2017. Maternal and children exposure to air pollutants was repeatedly assessed by personal monitors. DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, placenta, cord blood, meconium, child and mother stools, living cells, milk, hair and repeated urine samples were collected. A total of 484 pregnant women were recruited, with excellent compliance to the repeated urine sampling protocol (median, 43 urine samples per woman during pregnancy). The main health outcomes are child respiratory health using early objective measures, growth and neurodevelopment. Compared to former studies, the accuracy of assessment of non-persistent exposures is expected to be strongly improved in this new type of birth cohort tailored for the exposome concept, with deep phenotyping and extended exposure characterization. By targeting weaknesses in exposure assessment of the current approaches of cohorts on effects of early life environmental exposures with strong temporal variations, and relying on a rich biobank to provide insight on the underlying biological pathways whereby exposures affect health, this design is expected to provide deeper understanding of the interplay between the Exposome and child development and health.},

The major visibility-reducingaerosol species,sulfates, nitrates, organics,light-absorbingcarbon, and wind-blown dust are monitored as well as light scatteringand extinction. Sulfates and organicsare responsiblefor most of the extinction at most locations throughout the United States, while at sites in southern California nitrates are dominant. In the eastern United States, sulfates contribute to about two thirds of the extinction. In almost all cases, extinction and the major aerosol types are highest in the summer and lowest during the winter months.},

  abstract = {Aerosols and organic source apportionment were characterized using data collected during two measurement campaigns. These campaigns were conducted during the summer and winter seasons at Măgurele, a site located southwest of Bucharest, the capital of Romania and one of the largest cities in southeastern Europe (raking seven in Europe based on population). The summer campaign was conducted between 7 June\&ndash;18 July 2012, and the winter campaign from 14 January\&ndash;6 February 2013. Approximately 50\% of the organic fraction contribution to the total submicron particulate matter sampled by aerosol mass spectrometer was evidenced during both seasons. Submicronic organic aerosol sources were quantified using the positive matrix factorization approach. For warm (summer) and cold (winter) seasons, more than 50\% from total organics was represented by oxidized factors. For the summer season, separate analyses were conducted on data influenced by urban and non-urban sources. The influence of pollution from Bucharest on the measurement site was observed in aerosol concentration and composition. The primary organic aerosols have different contribution percentage during summer, depending on their main origin. The influence of Bucharest, during summer, included cooking contribution of 13\%. The periods with more regional influence were characterized by lower contribution from traffic and biomass burning in a total proportion of 28\%. In winter, the influence of local non-traffic sources was dominant. For more than 99\% of the measurements, the biomass burning indicator,     f 60    , exceeded the background value, with residential heating being an important source in this area. Fossil fuel contribution was confirmed for one week during the winter campaign, when      14    C analysis of total and elemental carbon revealed the presence of 17\% fossil contributions to total carbon. Mass spectrometry,      14    C and absorption data suggest biomass burning as the predominant primary source of organic aerosols for the winter season.},

In this study, HULIS\textsubscript{WS} mass concentration, various HULIS\textsubscript{WS} species, and dithiothreitol (DTT) activity of HULIS\textsubscript{WS} were quantified in PM\textsubscript{2.5} samples collected during a 1-year period in Beijing. Strong correlation was observed between HULIS\textsubscript{WS} and DTT activity; both exhibited higher levels during the heating season than during the nonheating season. Positive matrix factorization analysis of both HULIS\textsubscript{WS} and DTT activity was performed. Four combustion-related sources, namely coal combustion, biomass burning, waste incineration, and vehicle exhausts, and one secondary factor were resolved. In particular, waste incineration was identified as a source of HULIS\textsubscript{WS} for the first time. Biomass burning and secondary aerosol formation were the major contributors (\&gt;\&thinsp;59\&thinsp;\%) to both HULIS\textsubscript{WS} and associated DTT activity throughout the year. During the nonheating season, secondary aerosol formation was the most important source, whereas during the heating season, the predominant contributor was biomass burning. The four combustion-related sources accounted for \&gt;\&thinsp;70\&thinsp;\% of HULIS\textsubscript{WS} and DTT activity, implying that future reduction in PM\textsubscript{2.5} emissions from combustion activities can substantially reduce the HULIS\textsubscript{WS} burden and their potential health impact in Beijing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {To determine the size distribution of potentially toxic trace metals (TM) in atmospheric particulate matter (PM), sampling experiments were performed in the urban–industrial area of Dunkirk (North of France) during winter 2012. Total mass concentrations are in accordance with typical values obtained at European urban background sites but lower than the concentrations reported for some Asian industrial countries. Considering the local wind directions, mass concentrations are higher downwind of urban influences than downwind of industrial emissions. The mean PM10 mass concentration (25–30μg/m3) is less than the European Union and US EPA limit values (40–50μg/m3) but greater than the WHO guidelines (20μg/m3). The calculated TM crustal enrichment factors (EFCrust) suggest the anthropogenic origins of most of the studied TM (Sb, Cd, As, Mo, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Mn and V). The highest TM concentrations were obtained for Zn and Mn ({$>$}50ng/m3) under industrial influence, but the finest particle ({$<$} 0.29 μm) concentrations were higher for the urban sector than for the industrial sector. This enrichment may be attributed to local urban traffic. In contrast, trace metals are more abundant in the coarser fraction ({$>$} 0.29 μm) downwind of industrial emissions. Moreover, mechanical operations associated with industrial processes (excavating, crushing, and sintering), as well as the resuspension of industrial soils, likely represent some significant TM source-terms in the supermicronic fraction. The EFCrust comparison between the two prevailing sectors demonstrates the importance of steelworks and smelting emissions in the abundance of some TM (As, Cd, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Rb and Zn). In contrast, the Cr and Co concentrations seem to be more related to coal combustion emissions, Cu and Sb to automotive traffic, and V, La and Ni to petrochemical activities.},

In order to quantify and mitigate such effects, a wide range of processes leading to the formation and transport of pollutants must be considered, understood and represented in numerical models. Regional scale pollution episodes result from the combination of several factors: high emissions (from anthropogenic or natural sources), stagnant meteorological conditions, kinetics and efficiency of the chemistry and the deposition. All these processes are highly variable in time and space, and their relative contribution to the pollutants budgets can be quantified with chemistry-transport models. The CHIMERE chemistry-transport model is dedicated to regional atmospheric pollution event studies. Since it has now reached a certain level a maturity, the new stable version, CHIMERE 2013, is described to provide a reference model paper. The successive developments of the model are reviewed on the basis of published investigations that are referenced in order to discuss the scientific choices and to provide an overview of the main results.},

We propose a modelling study with the WRF-CHIMERE modelling suite for March 2020, an approach allowing to compare atmospheric composition with and without lockdown measures without the biases of meteorological conditions. This study shows that the lockdown effect on atmospheric composition, in particular through massive traffic reductions, has been important for several short-lived atmospheric trace species, with a large reduction in NO2 concentrations, a lower reduction in Particulate Matter (PM) concentrations and a mitigated effect on ozone concentrations due to non-linear chemical effects.},

  abstract = {The combustion of spruce logwood in a modern residential stove was found to emit polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAH) with emission factors of 404 μg MJ−1 of 35 analysed PAH, 317 μg MJ−1 of 11 analysed Oxy-PAH and 12.5 μg MJ−1 of 5 analysed OH-PAH, most of which are known as potential mutagens and carcinogens. Photochemical ageing in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) degraded particle-bound PAH, which was also reflected in declining PAH toxicity equivalent (PAH-TEQ) values by 45 to 80\% per equivalent day of photochemical ageing in the atmosphere. OPAH concentrations decreased less than PAH concentrations during photochemical ageing, supposedly due to their secondary formation, while 1-hydroxynaphthalene, 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene and 1,8-naphthalaldehydic acid were significantly increased after ageing. Furthermore, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and aromatic compounds not included in targeted analysis were investigated by thermal-optical carbon analysis (TOCA) hyphenate to resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (REMPI-TOFMS). The commonly used PAH-source indicators phenanthrene/anthracene, fluoranthene/pyrene, retene/chrysene, and indeno[cd]pyrene/benzo[ghi]perylene remained stable during photochemical ageing, enabling identification of wood combustion emissions in ambient air. On the other hand, benz[a]pyrene/benz[e]pyrene and benz[a]anthracene/chrysene were found to decrease with increasing photochemical age.

Both variables have substantial measurement error and, thus, are good test variables for our study.

Stable carbon isotopic composition of WSOC (\&delta;\textsuperscript{13}C\textsubscript{WSOC}) in total suspended particulate matter (TSP) exhibited a distinct seasonal cycle, with lower values from June through September (−25.5\&plusmn;0.5 \&permil;). This cycle follows the net CO\textsubscript{2} exchange between the forest ecosystem and the atmosphere, indicating that \&delta;\textsuperscript{13}C\textsubscript{WSOC} likely reflects the biological activity at the forest site. WSOC concentrations showed the highest values in early summer and autumn. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis indicated that the factor in which biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOAs) dominated accounted for \textasciitilde 40 \% of the highest concentrations of WSOC, where BSOAs mostly consisted of α-/β-pinene SOA. In addition, primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) made similar contributions (\textasciitilde 57 \%) to the WSOC near the forest floor in early summer. This finding indicates that the production of both primary and secondary WSOC aerosols is important during the growing season in a deciduous forest. The methanesulfonic acid (MSA) maximum was also found in early summer and had a distinct vertical gradient with larger concentrations near the forest floor. Together with the similar vertical gradients found for WSOC and \&delta;\textsuperscript{13}C\textsubscript{WSOC} as well as the α-/β-pinene SOA tracers, our results indicate that the forest floor, including ground vegetation and soil, acts as a significant source of WSOC in TSP within a forest canopy at the study site.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this context, a methodology for evaluating air quality model applications has been developed. This paper presents an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the FAIRMODE benchmarking approach, based on users’ feedback. European wide, regional and urban scale model applications, developed by different research groups over Europe, have been taken into account. The analysis is focused on the main pollutants under the Air Quality Directive, namely PM10, NO2 and O3. The different case studies are described and analysed with respect to the methodologies applied for model evaluation and quality assurance. This model evaluation intercomparison demonstrates the potential of a harmonised evaluation and benchmarking methodology. A SWOT analysis of the FAIRMODE benchmarking approach is performed based on feedback from users of the tool. This analysis helps to identify the main advantages and value of this model evaluation benchmarking approach compared with other methodologies, in addition to highlighting requirements for future development.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify and quantify sources contributing to particulate matter (PM10) at four urban background sites and an industrial site in North West Europe using a harmonized approach for aerosol sampling, laboratory analyses and statistical data processing. Filter samples collected every 6th day from April 2013 to May 2014 were analysed for metals, monosaccharide anhydrides, elemental and organic carbon, water-soluble ions and oxidative potential. The receptor-oriented model EPA-PMF 5.0.14 was used to carry out a source apportionment using the pooled data of all sites. A solution with 13 factor profiles was found which could be aggregated into eight groups: secondary aerosol; furnace slacks, road wear and construction; sea spray; mineral dust; biomass burning; industrial activities; traffic emissions and brake wear; and residual oil combustion. The largest part of PM10 (40–48\%) was explained by nitrate-rich and sulphate-rich secondary aerosol, followed by (aged) sea spray (11–21\%). Clear traffic and biomass burning profiles were also found. Conditional probability function plots were used to indicate the likely directions of the sources, while air mass back-trajectories were analysed using the HYSPLIT model. A better understanding of the composition and sources of particulate matter can facilitate the development of health-relevant air quality policies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In the Amazonian atmosphere, the aerosol coarse mode comprises a complex, diverse, and variable mixture of bioaerosols emitted from the rain forest ecosystem, long-range transported Saharan dust (we use Sahara as shorthand for the dust source regions in Africa north of the Equator), marine aerosols from the Atlantic Ocean, and coarse smoke particles from deforestation fires. For the rain forest, the coarse mode particles are of significance with respect to biogeochemical and hydrological cycling, as well as ecology and biogeography. However, knowledge on the physicochemical and biological properties as well as the ecological role of the Amazonian coarse mode is still sparse. This study presents results from multi-year coarse mode measurements at the remote Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) site. It combines online aerosol observations, selected remote sensing and modeling results, as well as dedicated coarse mode sampling and analysis. The focal points of this study are a systematic characterization of aerosol coarse mode abundance and properties in the Amazonian atmosphere as well as a detailed analysis of the frequent, pulse-wise intrusion of African long-range transport (LRT) aerosols (comprising Saharan dust and African biomass burning smoke) into the Amazon Basin.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}We find that, on a multi-year time scale, the Amazonian coarse mode maintains remarkably constant concentration levels (with 0.4cm\textsuperscript{−3} and 4.0µgm\textsuperscript{−3} in the wet vs. 1.2cm\textsuperscript{−3} and 6.5µgm\textsuperscript{−3} in the dry season) with rather weak seasonality (in terms of abundance and size spectrum), which is in stark contrast to the pronounced biomass burning-driven seasonality of the submicron aerosol population and related parameters. For most of the time, bioaerosol particles from the forest biome account for a major fraction of the coarse mode background population. However, from December to April there are episodic intrusions of African LRT aerosols, comprising Saharan dust, sea salt particles from the transatlantic passage, and African biomass burning smoke. Remarkably, during the core period of this LRT season (i.e., February–March), the presence of LRT influence, occurring as a sequence of pulse-like plumes, appears to be the norm rather than an exception. The LRT pulses increase the coarse mode concentrations drastically (up to 100µgm\textsuperscript{−3}) and alter the coarse mode composition as well as its size spectrum. Efficient transport of the LRT plumes into the Amazon Basin takes place in response to specific mesoscale circulation patterns in combination with the episodic absence of rain-related aerosol scavenging en route. Based on a modeling study, we estimated a dust deposition flux of 5–10kgha\textsuperscript{−1}a\textsuperscript{−1} in the region of the ATTO site. Furthermore, a chemical analysis quantified the substantial increase of crustal and sea salt elements under LRT conditions in comparison to the background coarse mode composition. With these results, we estimated the deposition fluxes of various elements that are considered as nutrients for the rain forest ecosystem. These estimates range from few gha\textsuperscript{−1}a\textsuperscript{−1} up to several hundreds of gha\textsuperscript{−1}a\textsuperscript{−1} in the ATTO region.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The long-term data presented here provide a statistically solid basis for future studies of the manifold aspects of the dynamic coarse mode aerosol cycling in the Amazon. Thus, it may help to understand its biogeochemical relevance in this ecosystem as well as to evaluate to what extent anthropogenic influences have altered the coarse mode cycling already.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Air quality in subway systems is of interest not only because particulate matter (PM) concentrations can be high, but also because of the peculiarly metalliferous chemical character of the particles, most of which differ radically from those of outdoor ambient air. We report on the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 samples collected in the Barcelona subway system in different types of stations. The PM chemical composition of these samples showed typically high concentrations of Fe, Total Carbon, Ba, Cu, Mn, Zn and Cr sourced from rail tracks, wheels, catenaries, brake pads and pantographs. Two toxicological indicators of oxidative activity, ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation (expressed as OPAA mgÀ1 or OPAA mÀ3) and glutathione (GSH) oxidation (expressed as OPGSH mgÀ1 or OPGSH mÀ3), showed low OP for all samples (compared with outdoor air) but considerable variation between stations (0.9e2.4 OPAA mgÀ1; 0.4e1.9 OPGSH mgÀ1). Results indicate that subway PM toxicity is not related to variations in PM2.5 concentrations produced by ventilation changes, tunnel works, or station design, but may be affected more by the presence of metallic trace elements such as Cu and Sb sourced from brakes and pantographs. The OP assays employed do not reveal toxic effects from the highly ferruginous component present in subway dust.},

To examine if these responses occur at environmentally relevant concentrations of DE, we exposed 25 healthy subjects to DE (PM10 100μg/m3, 0.6ppm NO2 for 2-h) and filtered air on separate occasions. Immediately following DE exposure, subjects displayed an increase in subjective symptoms and a mild bronchoconstriction. Six hours following the cessation of DE exposure neither airway inflammation, nor antioxidant depletion (ascorbate, urate, and reduced glutathione), was seen at any level of the respiratory tract. Instead, an increased flux of reduced glutathione into the bronchial (p{$<$}0.01) and nasal airways (p{$<$}0.05) was observed. In separate, in vitro experiments, DE was found to have comparable oxidative activity to the transition metal rich residual oil fly ash (ROFA) particle, significantly depleting lung lining fluid ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione in a transition metal and superoxide-dependent mechanism. Together, these data indicate that even though DE has marked oxidative activity, this effect is not observed to any great extent in the airways of healthy subjects. We interpret these findings as being indicative that the antioxidant network at the air–lung interface in healthy subjects is capable of dealing with the oxidative challenge posed by DE at ambient concentrations.},

In particular, the OH-initiated oxidation of pure pinic and pinonic acid, two well-known oxidation products of α-pinene, was investigated. Two complementary analytical techniques were used, on-line atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry (APCI/MS) and filter sampling followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS). The results show that 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA), a very low volatile α-pinene SOA product and a tracer compound for terpene SOA, is formed from the oxidation of pinonic acid and that this oxidation takes place in the gas phase. This finding is confirmed by temperature-dependent aging experiments on whole SOA formed from α-pinene, in which the yield of MBTCA scales with the pinonic acid fraction in the gas phase. Based on the results, several feasible gas-phase radical mechanisms are discussed to explain the formation of MBTCA from OH-initiated pinonic acid oxidation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although location and time–activity data have been used to model exposure to specific contaminants in epidemiological studies, little information is available about time–activity patterns of pregnant women. We measured changes in location-based activity patterns over the course of pregnancy (48-h periods, during two or three trimesters) using a self-reported time–activity log among a nonrandom sample of pregnant women (n=62). We assessed the influence of demographics and personal factors on changes in activity over pregnancy using mixed effects regression models. Increasing weeks of pregnancy was a significant predictor for increased time spent at home (1\,h/day increase for each trimester of pregnancy), after adjusting for income (2.6 more h/day at home in lowest income group), work status (3.5 more h/day at home for nonworkers) and other children in the family (1.5 more h/day at home with other children). No other measured activities (time outdoors, time in transit modalities or time in other indoor locations) were related to weeks of pregnancy. As our results indicate that pregnant women tend to spend more time at home during the latter stages of pregnancy, future exposure and epidemiological research should consider the potential increase in home-based exposures (i.e., indoor air pollution or chemicals in the home) late in pregnancy, and increased confidence in exposure proxies based on home locations or characteristics during the same period.},

              The normal biochemical reactions in our body, increased exposure to the environment, and higher levels of dietary xenobiotic's result in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The ROS and RNS create oxidative stress in different pathophysiological conditions. The reported chemical evidence suggests that dietary antioxidants help in disease prevention. The antioxidant compounds react in one-electron reactions with free radicals

              and prevent oxidative damage. Therefore, it is very important to understand the reaction mechanism of antioxidants with the free radicals. This review elaborates the mechanism of action of the natural antioxidant compounds and assays for the evaluation of their antioxidant activities. The reaction mechanisms of the antioxidant assays are briefly discussed (165 references). Practical applications: understanding the reaction mechanisms can help in evaluating the antioxidant activity of various antioxidant compounds as well as in the development of novel antioxidants.},

  abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was sampled at an urban background site in Tartu, Estonia over one-year period during the ECRHS II study. The elemental composition of 71PM2.5 samples was analyzed for different chemical elements using energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (ED-XRF). The oxidative activity of 36 samples was assessed by measuring their ability to generate hydroxyl radicals in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The origin of air masses was determined by computing 96-hour back trajectories of air masses with the HYSPLIT Model. The trajectories of air masses were divided into four sectors according to geographical patterns: “Russia,” “Eastern Europe,” “Western Europe,” and “Scandinavia.” During the study period, approximately 30\% of air masses originated from “Scandinavia.” The other three sectors had slightly lower values (between 18 and 22\%). In spring, summer, and winter, higher total PM levels originated from air masses from continental areas, namely “Russia” and “Eastern Europe” (18.51±7.33 and 19.96±9.23µgm−3, respectively). In autumn, the PM levels were highest in “Western Europe”. High levels of Fe, Ti, and AlCaSi (Al, Ca, and Si) were also detected in air masses from the Eurasian continent. The oxidative properties were correlated to the origin of air masses. The ⋅OH values were approximately 1.5 times higher when air masses originated from the direction of “Eastern Europe” or “Russia.” The origin of measured particles was evaluated using principal component factor analysis. When comparing the PM2.5 elemental composition with seasonal variation, factor scores, and other studies, the factors represent: (1) combustion of biomass; (2) crustal dust; (3) traffic; and (4) power plants and industrial processes associated with oil burning. The total PM2.5 is driven mainly by biomass and industrial combustion (63\%) and other unidentified sources (23\%). Other sources of PM, such as crustal dust and traffic, contribute a total of 13\%.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to atmospheric pollutants is a danger for the health of pregnant mother and children. Our objective was to identify individual (socioeconomic and behavioural) and contextual factors associated with atmospheric pollution pregnancy exposure at the nationwide level.
METHOD: Among 14\,921 women from the French nationwide ELFE (French Longitudinal Study of Children) mother-child cohort recruited in 2011, outdoor exposure levels of PM2.5, PM10 (particulate matter {$<$}2.5\,µm and {$<$}10\,µm in diameter) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) were estimated at the pregnancy home address from a dispersion model with 1\,km resolution. We used classification and regression trees (CART) and linear regression to characterise the association of atmospheric pollutants with individual (maternal age, body mass index, parity, education level, relationship status, smoking status) and contextual (European Deprivation Index, urbanisation level) factors.
RESULTS: Patterns of associations were globally similar across pollutants. For the CART approach, the highest tertile of exposure included mainly women not in a relationship living in urban and socially deprived areas, with lower education level. Linear regression models identified different determinants of atmospheric pollutants exposure according to the residential urbanisation level. In urban areas, atmospheric pollutants exposure increased with social deprivation, while in rural areas a U-shaped relationship was observed.
CONCLUSION: We highlighted social inequalities in atmospheric pollutants exposure according to contextual characteristics such as urbanisation level and social deprivation and also according to individual characteristics such as education, being in a relationship and smoking status. In French urban areas, pregnant women from the most deprived neighbourhoods were those most exposed to health-threatening atmospheric pollutants.},

  abstract = {Le concept de DOHaD (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease) postule que les expositions environnementales subies durant la phase de développement (vie fœtale et premières années de la vie) ont des conséquences majeures sur la santé ultérieure. La diminution du poids de naissance est considérée à la fois comme un marqueur de ces agressions subies par le fœtus au cours de la grossesse et comme un indicateur de la santé future de l’enfant. La recherche en épidémiologie sur les effets de la pollution  atmosphérique doit faire face au défi de l’évaluation de l’exposition aux polluants atmosphériques.
L’objectif général de cette thèse était de caractériser l’effet des polluants atmosphériques sur la croissance fœtale, en améliorant la caractérisation des expositions et le contrôle des biais de confusion potentiels par rapport aux études antérieures.
Dans une première partie, nous avons étudié les déterminants socio-économiques de l'exposition à la pollution de l’air ambiant dans l’étude nationale Française ELFE, incluant 18 000 couples mères-enfants. L'exposition maternelle aux particules fines (PM2,5 ), PM10 et au NO2 a été estimée à l'adresse du domicile à partir de modèles de dispersion avec  des résolutions spatiale (1x1 km) et temporelle (données journalières) fines. En France, dans les zones urbaines, les femmes enceintes des quartiers les plus défavorisés étaient les plus exposées à la pollution atmosphérique.
La deuxième partie de ce travail a porté sur la caractérisation de l'association entre les niveaux de pollution atmosphérique dans l’air extérieur durant la grossesse et le poids de naissance de l’enfant, toujours dans la cohorte ELFE. Une fois les facteurs de confusion pris en compte à l’aide d’un score de propension, nous avons mis en évidence un effet délétère de l’exposition aux particules en suspension dans l’air au cours du troisième trimestre de grossesse sur le poids de naissance.
Dans une troisième partie, nous avons comparé différentes approches pour évaluer l'exposition à la pollution atmosphérique chez la femme enceinte, incluant des mesures personnelles, chez 40 femmes de la cohorte SEPAGES-faisabilité. La considération du budget espace-temps ne modifiait que très légèrement les niveaux d’exposition estimés dans l’air extérieur à l’adresse du domicile. En revanche, l’exposition estimée était fortement modifiée par la prise en compte des niveaux de pollution atmosphérique à l’intérieur du domicile, ou quand l’exposition était estimée à l’aide de dosimètres personnels.
Ceci a justifié, dans une quatrième partie, d’étudier l'association entre l’exposition à la pollution atmosphérique estimée à l'aide de mesures personnelles et le développement du fœtus dans la cohorte grenobloise SEPAGES, incluant 471 triades couples-enfant. L’exposition personnelle aux PM 2,5 (n=174, plus nettement au 1 er trimestre) et au NO 2 (n=327, plus nettement au 3 ème trimestre) étaient associées à une diminution du poids de naissance. L’estimation ponctuelle de l’association avec les PM 2,5 était bien plus forte que dans la cohorte ELFE.
En conclusion, ce travail vient renforcer la littérature sur l’effet délétère de la pollution atmosphérique sur le poids de naissance. Cette thèse, basée sur deux cohortes complémentaires, a également permis d’illustrer le compromis entre biais et variance entre les études s’appuyant sur des modèles d’exposition extérieurs (pouvant être réalisées sur de vastes zones géographiques permettant des effectifs et contrastes d’exposition larges et avec potentiellement des biais de confusion et d’erreur de mesure sur l’exposition importants) et les cohortes s’appuyant sur des dosimètres personnels (généralement conduites sur des zones plus limitées, dans une population plus homogène, avec moins de biais de confusion potentiels et une meilleure estimation de l’exposition).},

  abstract = {This work examines the factor analysis of matrices where the proportion of signal and noise is very different in different columns (variables). Such matrices often occur when measuring elemental concentrations in environmental samples. In the strongest variables, the error level may be a few percent. For the weakest variables, the data may consist almost entirely of noise. This paper demonstrates that the proper scaling of weak variables is critical. It is found that if a few weak variables are scaled to too high a weight in the analysis, the errors in computed factors would grow, possibly obscuring the weakest factor(s) by the increased noise level. The mathematical explanation of this phenomenon is explored by means of Givens rotations. It is shown that the customary form of principal component analysis (PCA), based on autoscaling the original data, is generally very ineffective because the scaling of weak variables becomes much too high. Practical advice is given for dealing with noisy data in both PCA and positive matrix factorization (PMF).},

The goal of these methods is to capture the uncertainty of PMF analyses due to random errors and rotational ambiguity. It is shown that the three methods complement each other: depending on characteristics of the data set, one method may provide better results than the other two. Results are presented using synthetic data sets, including interpretation of diagnostics, and recommendations are given for parameters to report when documenting uncertainty estimates from EPA PMF or ME-2 applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Here we report results of a detailed analysis of the urban and non-urban contributions to particulate matter (PM) concentrations and source contributions in five European cities, namely Schiedam (the Netherlands, NL), Lens (France, FR), Leipzig (Germany, DE), Zurich (Switzerland, CH) and Barcelona (Spain, ES). PM chemically speciated data from 12 European paired monitoring sites (one traffic, five urban, five regional and one continental background) were analysed by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) and Lenschow's approach to assign measured PM and source contributions to the different spatial levels. Five common sources were obtained at the 12 sites: \emph{sulfate-rich} (SSA) and \emph{nitrate-rich } (NSA) aerosols, \emph{road traffic} (RT), \emph{mineral matter} (MM), and \emph{aged} \emph{sea salt} (SS). These sources explained from 55\&thinsp;\% to 88\&thinsp;\% of PM mass at urban low-traffic-impact sites (UB) depending on the country. Three additional common sources were identified at a subset of sites/countries, namely \emph{biomass burning} (BB) (FR, CH and DE), explaining an additional 9\&thinsp;\%–13\&thinsp;\% of PM mass, and \emph{residual oil combustion} (V–Ni) and \emph{primary} \emph{industrial }(IND) (NL and ES), together explaining an additional 11\&thinsp;\%–15\&thinsp;\% of PM mass. In all countries, the majority of PM measured at UB sites was of a regional+continental (R+C) nature (64\&thinsp;\%–74\&thinsp;\%). The R+C PM increments due to anthropogenic emissions in DE, NL, CH, ES and FR represented around 66\&thinsp;\%, 62\&thinsp;\%, 52\&thinsp;\%, 32\&thinsp;\% and 23\&thinsp;\%, respectively, of UB PM mass. Overall, the R+C PM increments due to natural and anthropogenic sources showed opposite seasonal profiles with the former increasing in summer and the latter increasing in winter, even if exceptions were observed. In ES, the anthropogenic R+C PM increment was higher in summer due to high contributions from regional SSA and V–Ni sources, both being mostly related to maritime shipping emissions at the Spanish sites. Conversely, in the other countries, higher anthropogenic R+C PM increments in winter were mostly due to high contributions from NSA and BB regional sources during the cold season. On annual average, the sources showing higher R+C increments were SSA (77\&thinsp;\%–91\&thinsp;\% of SSA source contribution at the urban level), NSA (51\&thinsp;\%–94\&thinsp;\%), MM (58\&thinsp;\%–80\&thinsp;\%), BB (42\&thinsp;\%–78\&thinsp;\%) and IND (91\&thinsp;\% in NL). Other sources showing high R+C increments were \emph{photochemistry} and \emph{coal combustion} (97\&thinsp;\%–99\&thinsp;\%; identified only in DE). The highest regional SSA increment was observed in ES, especially in summer, and was related to ship emissions, enhanced photochemistry and peculiar meteorological patterns of the Western Mediterranean. The highest R+C and urban NSA increments were observed in NL and associated with high availability of precursors such as NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} and NH\textsubscript{3}. Conversely, on average, the sources showing higher local increments were RT (62\&thinsp;\%–90\&thinsp;\% at all sites) and V–Ni (65\&thinsp;\%–80\&thinsp;\% in ES and NL). The relationship between SSA and V–Ni indicated that the contribution of ship emissions to the local sulfate concentrations in NL has strongly decreased since 2007 thanks to the shift from high-sulfur- to low-sulfur-content fuel used by ships. An improvement of air quality in the five cities included here could be achieved by further reducing local (urban) emissions of PM, NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} and NH\textsubscript{3} (from both traffic and non-traffic sources) but also SO\textsubscript{2} and PM (from maritime ships and ports) and giving high relevance to non-urban contributions by further reducing emissions of SO\textsubscript{2} (maritime shipping) and NH\textsubscript{3} (agriculture) and those from industry, regional BB sources and coal combustion.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The oxidative potential (OP) of fine and coarse fractions of ambient aerosols was studied in the urban environment of Athens, Greece. OP was quantified using a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, applied to the water soluble fraction of aerosol that was extracted from 361 fine and 84 coarse mode of 24-h and 12-h filter samples over a one-year period. During the cold period, samples were collected on a 12-h basis, to assess the impact of night-time biomass burning emissions from domestic heating on OP. The chemical characteristics of aerosols were measured in parallel using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitoring (ACSM) and a 7-wavelength Aethalometer. A source apportionment analysis on the ACSM data resulted in the identification of organic aerosol (OA) factors on a seasonal basis. A good correlation of OP with NO3−, NH4+, BC (Black Carbon), Organics and LV-OOA (low volatility oxygenated OA) was found during winter, revealing the importance of combustion and aging processes for OP. During the summertime, a good correlation between OP and SO4−2 and NH4+indicates its association with regional aerosol – thus the importance of oxidative aging that reduces its association with any characteristic source. Multiple regression analysis during winter revealed that highly oxygenated secondary aerosol (LV-OOA) and, to a lesser extent, fresh biomass burning (BBOA) and fossil fuel (HOA) organic aerosol, are the prime contributors to the OP of fine aerosol, with extrinsic toxicities of 54 ± 22 pmol min−1 μg−1, 28 ± 7 and 17 ± 4 pmol min−1μg−1, respectively. In summer, OP cannot be attributed to any of the identified components and corresponds to a background aerosol value. In winter however, the regression model can reproduce satisfactorily the water soluble DTT activity of fine aerosol, providing a unique equation for the estimation of aerosol OP in an urban Mediterranean environment.},

However, it is unlikely that all fine particles are equally toxic in view of their different sizes and chemical components. Toxicity of fine particles produced from various combustion sources (diesel engine, gasoline engine, biomass burning (rice straw and pine stem burning), and coal combustion) and non-combustion sources (road dust including sea spray aerosols, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols (SOA)), which are known major sources of PM2.5, was determined. Multiple biological and chemical endpoints were integrated for various source-specific aerosols to derive toxicity scores for particles originating from different sources. The highest toxicity score was obtained for diesel engine exhaust particles, followed by gasoline engine exhaust particles, biomass burning particles, coal combustion particles, and road dust, suggesting that traffic plays the most critical role in enhancing the toxic effects of fine particles. The toxicity ranking of fine particles produced from various sources can be used to better understand the adverse health effects caused by different fine particle types in the ambient atmosphere, and to provide practical management of fine particles beyond what can be achieved only using PM mass which is the current regulation standard.},

  abstract = {Background: Winds from the Sahara-Sahel desert region regularly transport large amounts of dust to the Americas, North Africa, and Europe. The presence of high dust concentrations for long periods of time, and the interaction between dust and man-made air pollution, raise concerns about adverse health effects and appropriate interventions by health authorities. This study tested the hypothesis that outbreaks of Saharan dust exacerbate the effects of man-made pollution, specifically fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10-2.5, respectively) on daily mortality.
Methods: We investigated the effects of exposure to PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 between March 2003 and December 2004 in Barcelona (Spain) on daily mortality; changes of effects between Saharan and non-Saharan dust days were assessed using a time-stratified casecrossover design. We studied the chemical composition of particulate matter to explain changes of effects.
Results: The study included 24,850 deaths. During Saharan dust days, a daily increase of 10 ␮g/m3 of PM10-2.5 increased daily mortality by 8.4\% (95\% confidence interval ϭ 1.5\%–15.8\%) compared with 1.4\% (Ϫ0.8\% to 3.4\%) during non-Saharan dust days (P value for interaction ϭ 0.05). In contrast, there was no increased risk of daily mortality for PM2.5 during Saharan dust days. Although coarse particles seem to be more hazardous during Saharan dust days, differences in chemical composition did not explain these observations.
Conclusions: Saharan dust outbreaks may have adverse health effects. Further investigation is needed to understand the role of coarse particles and the mechanism by which Saharan dust increases mortality.},

It contains the chemical composition of particulate matter emission sources reported in the scientific literature and reports drafted by competent authorities. The first release of SPECIEUROPE consists of 151 measured (original), 13 composite (merging different subcategories of similar sources), 6 calculated (from stoichiometric composition) and 39 derived (results of source apportionment studies) profiles. Each profile is related to one or more source categories or subcategories. The sources with the highest PM relative mass toxic pollutants such as PAHs are fuel oil burning, ship emissions, coke burning and wood burning. Heavy metals are most abundant in metal processing activities while halogens are mostly present in fertilizer production, coal burning and metallurgic sector. Anhydrosugars are only measured in biomass and wood burning source categories, because are markers for these categories. The alkaline earth metals are mostly present in road dust, cement production, soil dust and sometimes coal burning. Source categories like traffic and industrial, which contain heterogeneous subcategories, show the greatest internal variability. The relationships between sources profiles were also explored using a cluster analysis approach based upon the Standardized Identity Distance (SID) indicator. The majority of profiles are allocated in 8 major clusters. Some of the clusters include profiles mainly from one source category (e.g. wood burning) while others, such as industrial source profiles, are more heterogeneous and spread over three different clusters.},

  abstract = {In this study, PM2.5 airborne particulate matter was collected over a full year at a costal site of the Central Mediterranean Sea and analysed for its chemical composition and oxidative potential (OP), determined by the dithiothreitol (DTT) and the ascorbic acid (AA) assays. In autumn-winter, the volume normalized oxidative OP (OPV) were 0.29 ± 0.03 nmol min−1 m−3 and 0.21 ± 0.03 nmol min−1 m−3 for the DTT (OPDTTV) and AA (OPAAV) assay, respectively. In spring-summer the OPDTTV values were higher than OPAAV responses, i.e., 0.19 ± 0.02 nmol min−1 m−3 vs. 0.09 ± 0.01 nmol min−1 m−3. Overall, marked seasonality was observed with higher values in Autumn-Winter (AW) than in Spring-Summer (SS), i.e., 1.5 and 2.3 times increase for OPDTTV and OPAAV, respectively. In the cold season, the OPV activity was broadly correlated with metals and carbon species, such as K+, NO3−, Ba, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, P, V, OC, EC, Acetate, Oxalate and Glycolate (p {$<$} 0.05). This suggested the main contribution of a “mixed anthropogenic” source, consisting of the biomass burning (K+, OC and EC) and traffic (Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, V, EC) emissions. In SS, OPV was significantly correlated with only few species i.e., OC, EC, Cu, and NO3−, suggesting main association with the “mixed anthropogenic” and the “reacted dust” sources. For each sampling day, PM2.5 and PM10 samples were simultaneously collected and analysed to investigate the variation of the OP activity in relation with the particle size and chemical composition. OPDTTV values exhibited a poor particle-size dependence, with similar values close to 0.20 ± 0.04 nmol min−1 m−3 in both fractions. This could be explained by the association of OPDTTV with species mainly accumulated in the fine fraction, i.e., OC, POC and EC and K+. Otherwise, the OPAAV responses exhibited a clear particle-size dependence, with significantly higher values for PM10 than for PM2.5, i.e., 0.35 ± 0.06 vs. 0.21 ± 0.03 nmol min−1 m−3 in AW and 0.23 ± 0.04 vs. 0.09 ± 0.01 in SS. This may be supported by the strong correlation of OPAAV with Cu and Fe, which were most abundant metals in the PM10 fraction. The data of specific monitoring days were investigated in detail to better highlight the impact of some individual redox active species on the OPDTTV and OPAAV responses.},

A Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was applied to a sampling filter-based chemical dataset obtained for the April 2015 to January 2017 period. Nine factors were clearly identified, showing mainly contributions from anthropogenic sources of primary PM (19.2\% and 16.1\% for traffic and biomass burning, respectively) as well as secondary aerosols (12.3\%, 14.5\%, 21.8\% for sulfate-, nitrate-, and oxalate-rich factors, respectively). Wood-burning aerosols exhibited strong temporal variations and contributed up to 30\% of the PM mass fraction during winter, while primary traffic concentrations remained relatively constant throughout the year. These two sources are also the main contributors during observed PM10 pollution episodes. Furthermore, the dominance of the oxalate-rich factor among other secondary aerosol factors underlines the role of atmospheric processing to secondary organic aerosol loadings which are still poorly characterized in this region. Finally, Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis were performed to investigate the geographical origins of the apportioned sources, notably illustrating a significant transport of both nitrate-rich and sulfate-rich factors from Northeastern Europe but also from the Balkan region.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Online non-refractory submicron aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements in urban areas have successfully allowed the apportionment of specific sources and/or physical and chemical properties of the organic fraction. However, in order to be fully representative of PM pollution, a comprehensive source apportionment analysis is needed by taking into account all major components of submicron aerosols, creating strengthened bonds between the organic components and pollution sources. We present here a novel two-step methodology to perform such an analysis, by taking advantage of high time resolution of monitoring instruments: the aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and the multi-wavelength absorption measurements (Aethalometer AE31) in Paris, France. As a first step, organic aerosols (OA) were deconvolved to hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA) and oxygenated OA (OOA) with positive matrix factorization (PMF), and black carbon was deconvolved into its wood burning and fossil fuel combustion fractions. A second PMF analysis was then carried out with organic factors, BC fractions and inorganic species (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride), leading to a four-factor solution allowing highly time-resolved characterization of the major sources of PM\textsubscript{1}. Outputs of this PMF\textsuperscript{2} include two dominant combustion sources (wood burning and traffic) as well as semi-volatile and low-volatile secondary aerosols. While HOA is found to be emitted by both wood burning and traffic, the latter sources occurred to significantly contribute also to OOA.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Over the last years, various acellular assays have been used for the evaluation of the oxidative potential (OP) of particular matter (PM) to predict PM capacity to generate reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species in biological systems. However, relationships among OP and PM toxicological effects on living organisms are still largely unknown. This study aims to assess the effects of atmospheric PM-selected components (brake dust - BD, pellet ash - PA, road dust - RD, certified urban dust NIST1648a - NIST, soil dust - S, coke dust - C and Saharan dust - SD) on the model plant A. thaliana development, with emphasis on their capacity to induce oxidative stress and root morphology alteration. Before growing A. thaliana in the presence of the PM-selected components, each atmospheric dust has been chemically characterized and tested for the OP through dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbic acid (AA) and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) assays. After the exposure, element bioaccumulation in the A. thaliana seedlings, i.e., in roots and shoots, was determined and both morphological and oxidative stress analyses were performed in roots. The results indicated that, except for SD and S, all the tested dusts affected A. thaliana root system morphology, with the strongest effects in the presence of the highest OPs dusts (BD, PA and NIST). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed correlations among OPs of the dusts, element bioaccumulation and root morphology alteration, identifying the most responsible dust-associated elements affecting the plant. Lastly, histochemical analyses of NO and O2− content and distribution confirmed that BD, PA and NIST induce oxidative stress in A. thaliana, reflecting the high OPs of these dusts and ultimately leading to cell membrane lipid peroxidation.},

With the purpose of designing an experimental set-up mostly representative of the intracellular oxidation, the assay was performed in different media, representing an artificial respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), i.e., simple ascorbate (Asc) or mixtures of reduced glutathione (GSH), urate (UA) and citrate (Cit). The study was performed on real PM2.5 samples collected at an urban and rural site in the Po Valley (northern Italy). For comparison, standard solutions of redox-active species were investigated, i.e., Cu2+, Fe2+, 1,2-naphthoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone and 9,10-phenantrenequinone, that are known to give positive response to the AA assay. The composition of the synthetic RTLF strongly effected the OPAA responses, as they decreased with increasing the mixture complexity, following the order: Asc~{$>~$}Asc~+~Cit~{$>~$}Asc~+~UA~{$>~$}Asc~+~GSH~{$>~$}Asc~+~Cit~+~GSH~∼~Asc~+~Cit~+~GSH~+~UA.

  abstract = {The chemical composition and oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM10) samples were investigated at an industrial (Ala) and a background (TN) site in northern Italy. Three emission sources of airborne metals were identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis, i.e., the zinc coating facility located in the area, the traffic on the nearby motorway and the pesticides normally used in the extensive vineyard cultivation. PM10 redox activity was measured using dithiothreitol (OPDTTV) and ascorbic acid (OPAAV) cell-free assays. Similar OPDTTV responses were obtained at the two sites (0.60 ± 0.23 mmol min−1 m−3), while higher (OPAAV) values were measured at Ala (1.4 ± 1.1 nmol min−1 m−3) than at TN (0.7 ± 0.4 nmol min−1 m−3). Overall, both OPDTTV and OPAAV responses were found to be broadly correlated with several inorganic species, namely ions and soluble metals, and organic components. In particular, OPAAV responses are mainly affected by Zn directly emitted from the zinc factory and Cu used in the vineyard cultivation. Therefore, the higher OPAAV values measured at Ala can be explained by the higher concentration of these metals at the industrial site.},

  abstract = {An extended study on the oxidative potential (OP) of PM10 particles collected from December 2014 to October 2015 at a peninsular site of the Central Mediterranean basin has been performed. PM10 particles have been selected to better account for all different aged/fresh particle types. Two acellular assays, i.e., the dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbic acid (AA) methods, were used to measure the OP of PM10 particles chemically speciated by more than 40 species. DTT and AA assays provide close mean values of volume normalized OPV responses, with similar variability range, i.e., mean OPDTTV = 0.24 ± 0.12 nmolDTT min−1 m−3 and mean OPAAV = 0.29 ± 0.18 nmolAA min−1 m−3. Also mass normalized OPm responses are similar for both assays, with mean value close to 0.008 nmol min−1 μg−1. The measured OPDTTV and OPAAV are correlated with several inorganic species, namely ions and metals, and with organic/elemental carbon. The discrimination of the data according seasonality, i.e., Autumn-Winter (AW, October–March) and Spring-Summer (SS, April–September) days, shows a clear seasonal trend of correlation coefficients. In AW, OPDTTV is strongly correlated with nss-K+ and nss-Ca2+, in addition to Ba, Cd, Ce, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Mn (traffic-related metals) and with EC, OC, and POC associated with the traffic exhaust source and/or with the combustion including biomass-burning source. Otherwise, OPDTTV of SS samples is correlated only with NH4+, Cu, EC, OC, and POC. The OPAAV of AW samples is well correlated with Ba, Ce, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, nss-K+, EC, OC, and POC, which are related with traffic and/or combustion emissions. Conversely, in SS, OPAAV is mainly correlated with NH4+, nss-K+, nss-Mg2+, nss-Ca2+, nss-SO42−, Cu, Mn, P, Pb, and oxalate, that are species related to secondary aerosols and resuspended soil from vehicular traffic and/or transported Saharan dust. These findings point the importance of both organic components and transition metals to PM oxidative properties, and also suggest that synergistic/antagonistic interactions and cross-correlations between the PM redox-active components are likely responsible for the seasonal variation of the AA and DTT assay response. The inter-correlation among all analysed species has been investigated to explain contrasting results and the negative correlations between OP values and some chemical species.},

  abstract = {This work is an overview of the oxidative potential (OP) values up to date measured in Italy, with the aim to provide a picture of the spatial and seasonal variability of OP in the various geographical areas across Italy. The summarized works used the common acellular assays-based dithiothreitol (OPDTT), ascorbic acid (OPAA), glutathione (OPGSH), and 2\&prime;,7\&prime;-dichlorodfluorescein (OPDCFH) assays. The paper describes the association of OP responses with PM chemical composition, the sensitivity of various acellular OP assays to PM components and emission sources, and PM size distribution of the measured OP values. Our synthesis indicates that crustal and transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn, and V), secondary ions and carbonaceous components (elemental carbon, EC, organic carbon, OC and water soluble carbon, WSOC) show significant correlations with OP across different urban and rural areas and size ranges. These chemical species are mainly associated with various PM sources, including residual/fuel oil combustion, traffic emissions, and secondary organic aerosol formation. Although the OP assays are sensitive to the same redox-active species, they differ in the association with PM chemical components. The DDT assay is mainly sensitive to the organic compounds that are mostly accumulated in the fine PM fraction, i.e., tracers of burning sources, and redox active organics associated with other markers of photochemical aging. In contrast, OPAA and OPGSH were mostly responsive to metals, mainly those related to non-exhaust traffic emissions (Cu, Zn, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mn, Sn, Cd, Pb), that are mainly accumulated in the coarse PM. Among the investigated sites, our synthesis shows larger OP values in Trentino region and the Po Valley, that may be explained by the high density of anthropogenic sources, and the orographic and meteorological characteristics, that favor the pollutants accumulation and aerosol photo-oxidative aging.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The determination of atmospheric concentrations of levoglucosan and its two isomers, unambiguous tracers of biomass burning emissions, became even more important with the development of wood as renewable energy for domestic heating. Many researches demonstrated the increase during recent years of atmospheric particulate matter load due to domestic biomass combustion in developed countries. Analysis of biomass burning tracers is traditionally performed with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) technique after derivatization and requires an organic solvent extraction. A simpler and faster technique using Liquid Chromatography \&ndash; Electrospray Ionisation \&ndash; tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was optimized for the analysis of levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan isomers after an aqueous extraction. This technique allows a good separation between the three compounds in a very reduced time (runtime \textasciitilde 5 min). LOD and LOQ of this method are 30 μg l\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} and 100 μg l\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} respectively, allowing the use of filters from low-volume sampler (as commonly used in routine campaigns). A comparison of simultaneous levoglucosan measurements by GC-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS for about 50 samples coming from different types of sampling sites and seasons was realized and shows very good agreement between the two methods. Therefore LC-ESI-MS/MS method can be used as an alternative to GC-MS particularly for measurement campaigns in routine where analysis time is important and detection limit is reduced. This paper shows that this method is also applicable to other environmental sample types like soil.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A receptor-oriented model is developed to identify and locate the sources of the constituents present in precipitation collected at two rural French stations, namely Donon and Morvan. Firstly, factor analysis is applied to the chemical data sets. Three factors are identified reproducing the concentrations observed in precipitation. These factors represent the acid sources (characterized by the ionic combination between H+, SO42− and NO3−), marine sources (Na+, Cl− and Mg2+) and crustal sources (Ca2+ and K+). Then, the factor scores of samples are combined with the air parcel back trajectories in the same scheme of model calculation to produce the probability maps of source locations. This approach, called potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis, locates the acid sources in the industrial areas of Northeastern Europe and Great Britain, the marine sources in the Atlantic Ocean and the crustal sources around the Mediterranean Basin. The seasonal profiles of these factors are performed and contrasted with the atmospheric processes and meteorological conditions which prevail in each season. A classification of these daily samples is also made according to four origin sectors, to examine the variations in ionic composition of precipitations from one sector to another. The results of this classification are in agreement with the source locations found by the PSCF analysis.},

  abstract = {The fine particle ({$<$}2.5 μm) composition data from seven National Park Service locations in Alaska for the period from 1986 to 1995 was performed using a new type of factor analysis, positive matrix factorization (PMF). This method uses the estimates of the error in the data to provide optimum data point scaling and permits a better treatment of missing and below detection limit values. Eight source components were obtained for data sets from the Northwest Alaska Areas and the Bering Land Bridge sites. Five to seven components were obtained for the other Alaskan sites. The solutions were normalized by using aerosol fine mass concentration data. Squared correlation coefficients between the reconstructed mass obtained from aerosol composition data for the sites and the measured mass were in the range of 0.74–0.95. Two factors identified as soils were obtained for all of the sites. Concentrations for these factors for most of the sites have maxima in the summer and minima in the winter. A sea-salt component was found at five locations. A factor with the highest concentrations of black carbon (BC), H+, and K identified as forest fire smoke was obtained for all data sets except at Katmai. Factors with high concentrations of S, BC-Na-S, and Zn-Cu were obtained at all sites. At three sites, the solutions also contained a factor with high Pb and Br values. The factors with the high S, Pb, and BC-Na-S values at most sites show an annual cycle with maxima during the winter-spring season and minima in the summer. The seasonal variations and elemental compositions of these factors suggest anthropogenic origins with the spatial pattern suggesting that the sources are distant from the receptor sites. The seasonal maxima/minima ratios of these factors were higher for more northerly locations. Four main sources contribute to the observed concentrations at these locations: long-range transported anthropogenic aerosol (Arctic haze aerosol), sea-salt aerosol, local soil dust, and aerosol with high BC concentrations from regional forest fires or local wood smoke. A northwest to southeast negative gradient suggesting long-range transport of air masses from regions north or northwest of Alaska dominated the spatial distribution of the high S factor concentrations.},

  abstract = {This paper synthesizes data on aerosol (or particulate matter, PM) chemical characteristics, which were obtained in European aerosol research activities at natural, rural, near-city, urban, and kerbside sites over the past decade. It includes only two (nearby) sites in the semi-arid Mediterranean area, and lacks data from Eastern Europe. PM chemical compositions are compared with the PM mass concentrations in PM10, PM2.5, and further size resolved PM fractions (chemical mass closure). Such data sets are more comprehensive than those currently provided by air quality monitoring networks (e.g. EMEP, EUROAIRNET). Data available from 24 sites in Europe were reviewed. They were processed and plotted to allow comparisons in spite of differences in the sampling and analytical techniques used in various studies. A number of conclusions are drawn among which are the following. Organic matter appears to be the major component of PM10 and PM2.5, except at natural and rural background sites, where sulphate contribution may be larger. Mineral dust shows up as a major component of PM10 at kerbside sites. Black carbon contributes 5–10\% to PM2.5 and somewhat less to PM10 at all sites, including the natural background sites. Its contribution seems higher (15–20\%) at some of the kerbside sites, but these data may be affected by analytical artefacts. On days when PM10 {$>$}50μgm−3, nitrate concentrations can overtake organic matter concentrations in PM10 and PM2.5. High PM concentration episodes are often observed in cold periods, when the pollutant dispersion is least. Measurements indicate that the condensation in the particle phase of semi-volatile species like nitrate and (unspecified) organics is also favoured by cold temperatures. In particles with a diameter {$<$}150nm (i.e., most atmospheric particles), organic matter and black carbon are by far the major components. More data are known to be available within the scientific community, which could enrich the present data set and strengthen the conclusions made above. Most of them are not made available yet. The investment in new approaches, which would bridge the technological gap between scientific measurements and regulatory monitoring networks, is strongly needed.},

For all the aged dilute diesel systems, ROS expression increased by a factor of 2e4 over fresh diesel particles. Other particle systems were also investigated. A low ROS was observed in most of the nighttime experiments, including the nighttime aerosols from SO2 with O3 and SO2 aged by itself. However, when all the systems were compared, aged diesel exhaust tended to express very high ROS potentials, with secondary organic aerosols from an apinene þ toluene þ an urban HC mixture giving the highest ROS response.},

  abstract = {Urban aerosol samples collected in Barcelona between 2008 and 2009 were toxicologically characterised by means of two complementary methodologies allowing evaluation of their Reactive Oxidative Stress (ROS)-generating capacity: the plasmid scission assay (PSA) and the dichlorodihydrofluorescin assay (DCFH). The PSA determined the PM dose able to damage 50\% of a plasmid DNA molecule (TD50 values), an indication of the ability of the sample to exert potential oxidative stress, most likely by formation of Á OH. This toxicity indicator did not show dependency on different air mass origins (African dust, Atlantic advection), indicating that local pollutant sources within or near the city are most likely to be mainly responsible for PM health effect variations. The average TD50 values show PM2.5–0.1 samples to be more toxic than the PM10–2.5 fraction, with doses similar to those reported in previous studies in polluted urban areas. In addition, the samples were also evaluated using the oxidant-sensitive probe DCFH confirming the positive association between the amount of DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxidant species capable of inducing DNA strand break. Results provided by the PSA were compared with those from two other different methodologies to evaluate human health risk: (1) the toxicity of particulate PAHs expressed as the calculated toxicity equivalent of benzo[a]pyrene (BaPteq) after application of the EPA toxicity factors, and (2) the cancer risk assessment of the different PM sources detected in Barcelona with the receptor model Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) and the computer programme Multilinear Engine 2 (ME-2) using the organic and inorganic chemical compositions of particles. No positive associations were found between PSA and the toxicity of PAHs, probably due to the inefficiency of water in extracting organic compounds. On the other hand, the sum of cancer risk estimates calculated for each of the selected days for the PSA was found to correlate with TD50 values in the fine fraction, with fuel oil combustion and industrial emissions therefore being most implicated in negative health effects. Further studies are necessary to determine whether toxicity is related to PM chemical composition and sources, or rather to its size distribution. \& 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {L'impact des particules fines (PM10-PM2.5) sur la santé a été largement étudié depuis de nombreuses années, notamment pour les sites de proximité automobile. De nombreux dépassements de la valeur limite en PM10 imposée par les directives européennes ont lieu en France et en Europe, en milieu urbain et plus fréquemment en proximité automobile. Les émissions véhiculaires sont une des sources majeures de particules. Ces émissions proviennent à la fois des échappements (TE) mais aussi des émissions hors échappement (TNE) (abrasion des freins, des pneus et de la route, resuspension des poussières de la chaussée dû au déplacement des véhicules…). En France, très peu d'études en proximité automobile ont été effectuées. Les études de déconvolution des sources en France et en Europe s'appuient la plupart du temps sur des parcs automobiles non adaptés (parc américain) ou trop anciens. De plus, seule la source TE est considérée, ce qui sous-estime largement la contribution véhiculaire aux PM10. La meilleure connaissance de la formation, de la caractérisation et de la quantification des particules émises par le trafic est devenue primordiale. L'objectif final étant la détermination des contributions des émissions véhiculaires TE et TNE aux sources primaires de particules, la caractérisation précise de ces sources est primordial. Pour cela, la recherche de traceurs véhiculaires en phases gaz et particulaire a constitué une grosse partie de ce travail. La combinaison de l'étude sur banc à rouleau de cinq véhicules bien représentés dans le parc automobile roulant français et de l'étude effectuée en proximité automobile (Rocade Sud de Grenoble) a constitué le socle de ce travail. Dans la première étude, certains composés chimiques sont apparus comme indicateurs des émissions TE (EC, HAP légers, profils d'alcanes typiques, quelques métaux comme Fe, Cu etc.). Des différences importantes sont observées entre les véhicules diesel sans filtre à particules (FAP) et les véhicules essence et diesel sans FAP. La seconde étude, comparant le site trafic (Grenoble-Echirolles) avec un site de fond urbain (Grenoble- Les Frênes), a mis en évidence certains composés chimiques comme spécifiques des sources TNE et TE sur la base des connaissances acquises avec les mesures sur banc et sur l'enrichissement de certains composés par rapport au site de fond (EC, Cu, Fe, Sn, Mn…). On peut souligner certains enrichissements majeurs comme EC (78\%), Cu (82\%), Fe (88\%), etc. La résolution temporelle a été faite sur une base de 4h, permettant ainsi une caractérisation chimique détaillée en fonction des heures de pointe et "creuses". Une troisième étude, en site trafic également (Grenoble-Le Rondeau) mais sous influence du salage en hiver, est venue compléter nos recherches. Enfin, en nous appuyant sur les résultats de la première partie, nous avons cherché à déconvoluer les sources véhiculaires TE et TNE (Echirolles et Le Rondeau) au moyen d'un modèle statistique d'analyses multivariées, la PMF (Positive Matrix Factorization), apportant ainsi la contribution possible de ces sources aux PM10. Les émissions véhiculaires (TNE+ TE) y contribuent à 34\% à Echirolles et à 53\% au Rondeau. Quelques incertitudes sont discutées par rapport aux résultats trouvés avec ceux provenant de l'étude géochimique détaillée en première partie.},

  abstract = {Air pollution and climate change are potential drivers for the increasing burden of allergic diseases. The molecular mechanisms by which air pollutants and climate parameters may influence allergic diseases, however, are complex and elusive. This article provides an overview of physical, chemical and biological interactions between air pollution, climate change, allergens, adjuvants and the immune system, addressing how these interactions may promote the development of allergies. We reviewed and synthesized key findings from atmospheric, climate, and biomedical research. The current state of knowledge, open questions, and future research perspectives are outlined and discussed. The Anthropocene, as the present era of globally pervasive anthropogenic influence on planet Earth and, thus, on the human environment, is characterized by a strong increase of carbon dioxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and combustion- or traffic-related particulate matter in the atmosphere. These environmental factors can enhance the abundance and induce chemical modifications of allergens, increase oxidative stress in the human body, and skew the immune system toward allergic reactions. In particular, air pollutants can act as adjuvants and alter the immunogenicity of allergenic proteins, while climate change affects the atmospheric abundance and human exposure to bioaerosols and aeroallergens. To fully understand and effectively mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution and climate change on allergic diseases, several challenges remain to be resolved. Among these are the identification and quantification of immunochemical reaction pathways involving allergens and adjuvants under relevant environmental and physiological conditions.},

  abstract = {Particulate concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) including, 17 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 9 oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and 18 nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) were determined at traffic and suburban sites located in the region of Paris. A 12h sampling basis time resolution was applied in order to study their diurnal and nocturnal variations. Observed concentrations were about 10 times higher at the traffic site for all compounds and were higher during the night-time for both sites (except for NPAHs at the traffic site). No significant differences in PAH and OPAH profiles were observed at both sites whereas, for NPAHs, 1-nitropyrene (diesel source) was the most abundant at the traffic site and 2+3-nitrofluoranthene (secondary formed by gas-phase reaction) was predominant at the suburban site. The study of the specific ratio 2-nitrofluoranthene/1-nitropyrene (2-NFlt/1-NP) showed a local formation of NPAHs in gaseous phase at the suburban site. A detailed analysis showed that atmospheric humidity and rainfalls modified differently PAH and NPAH profiles, in comparison to OPAH. A difference of the scale variability of water solubility between, light (MW≤228gmol−1) and heavy compounds (MW≥273gmol−1), could explain these observations. The specific study of the relationships between PACs and other measured pollutants highlighted that particle resuspension could constitute a significant source of PM on the traffic site. Even if NPAH formation seemed clearly evident at the suburban site during periods characterised by high O3 and NO2 concentration levels, results showed also that the primary and/or secondary origins of OPAHs and NPAHs were strongly dependent on the sampling site and on sampling conditions. Finally, we conclude that higher time sampling resolutions would be helpful in investigating the atmospheric chemistry and behaviours of PACs in correlation with the local meteorological variations and the daily cycle of human activities.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Urbanization and deforestation have important impacts on atmospheric particulate matter (PM) over Amazonia. This study presents observations and analysis of PM\textsubscript{1} concentration, composition, and optical properties in central Amazonia during the dry season, focusing on the anthropogenic impacts. The primary study site was located 70\&thinsp;km downwind of Manaus, a city of over 2 million people in Brazil, as part of the GoAmazon2014/5 experiment. A high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) provided data on PM\textsubscript{1} composition, and aethalometer measurements were used to derive the absorption coefficient \emph{b}\textsubscript{abs,BrC} of brown carbon (BrC) at 370\&thinsp;nm. Non-refractory PM\textsubscript{1} mass concentrations averaged 12.2\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3} at the primary study site, dominated by organics (83\&thinsp;\%), followed by sulfate (11\&thinsp;\%). A decrease in \emph{b}\textsubscript{abs,BrC} was observed as the mass concentration of nitrogen-containing organic compounds decreased and the organic PM\textsubscript{1} O:C ratio increased, suggesting atmospheric bleaching of the BrC components. The organic PM\textsubscript{1} was separated into six different classes by positive-matrix factorization (PMF), and the mass absorption efficiency \emph{E}\textsubscript{abs} associated with each factor was estimated through multivariate linear regression of \emph{b}\textsubscript{abs,BrC} on the factor loadings. The largest \emph{E}\textsubscript{abs} values were associated with urban (2.04±0.14\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{2}\&thinsp;g\textsuperscript{−1}) and biomass-burning (0.82±0.04 to 1.50±0.07\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{2}\&thinsp;g\textsuperscript{−1}) sources. Together, these sources contributed at least 80\&thinsp;\% of \emph{b}\textsubscript{abs,BrC} while accounting for 30\&thinsp;\% to 40\&thinsp;\% of the organic PM\textsubscript{1} mass concentration. In addition, a comparison of organic PM\textsubscript{1} composition between wet and dry seasons revealed that only part of the 9-fold increase in mass concentration between the seasons can be attributed to biomass burning. Biomass-burning factor loadings increased by 30-fold, elevating its relative contribution to organic PM\textsubscript{1} from about 10\&thinsp;\% in the wet season to 30\&thinsp;\% in the dry season. However, most of the PM\textsubscript{1} mass (\&gt;60\&thinsp;\%) in both seasons was accounted for by biogenic secondary organic sources, which in turn showed an 8-fold seasonal increase in factor loadings. A combination of decreased wet deposition and increased emissions and oxidant concentrations, as well as a positive feedback on larger mass concentrations are thought to play a role in the observed increases. Furthermore, fuzzy \emph{c}-means clustering identified three clusters, namely “baseline”, “event”, and “urban” to represent different pollution influences during the dry season. The baseline cluster, representing the dry season background, was associated with a mean mass concentration of 9±3\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3}. This concentration increased on average by 3\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3} for both the urban and the event clusters. The event cluster, representing an increased influence of biomass burning and long-range transport of African volcanic emissions, was characterized by remarkably high sulfate concentrations. The urban cluster, representing the influence of Manaus emissions on top of the baseline, was characterized by an organic PM\textsubscript{1} composition that differed from the other two clusters. The differences discussed suggest a shift in oxidation pathways as well as an accelerated oxidation cycle due to urban emissions, in agreement with findings for the wet season.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {An emerging hypothesis in the field of air pollution is that oxidative stress is one of the important pathways leading to adverse health effects of airborne particulate matter (PM). To advance our understanding of sources and chemical elements contributing to aerosol oxidative potential and provide global comparative data, we report here on the biological oxidative potential associated with size-segregated airborne PM in different urban areas of the world, measured by a biological (cell-based) reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay. Our synthesis indicates a generally greater intrinsic PM oxidative potential as well as higher levels of exposure to redox-active PM in developing areas of the world. Moreover, on the basis of our observations, smaller size fractions are generally associated with higher intrinsic ROS activity compared with larger PM size fractions. Another important outcome of our study is the identification of major species and sources that are associated with ROS activity. Water-soluble transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn and V) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) showed consistent correlations with the oxidative potential of airborne PM across different urban areas and size ranges. The major PM sources associated with these chemical species include residual/fuel oil combustion, traffic emissions, and secondary organic aerosol formation, indicating that these sources are major drivers of PM-induced oxidative potential. Moreover, comparison of ROS activity levels across different seasons indicated that photochemical aging increases the intrinsic oxidative potential of airborne PM.},

  abstract = {Impacted by a complex mixture of urban, industrial, shipping and also natural emissions, Marseille, the second most populated city in France, represents a very interesting case study for the apportionment of PM2.5 sources in a Mediterranean urban environment. In this study, daily PM2.5 samples were collected over a one-year period (2011−2012) at an urban background site, and were comprehensively analyzed for the determination of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), major ions, trace elements/metals and specific organic markers. A constrained positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis using the ME-2 (multilinear engine-2) solver was applied to this dataset. PMF results highlighted the presence of two distinct fingerprints for biomass burning (BB1 and BB2). BB1, assigned to open green waste burning peaks in fall (33\%; 7.4 μg m−3) during land clearing periods, is characterized by a higher levoglucosan/OC ratio, while BB2, assigned to residential heating, shows the highest contribution during the cold period in winter (14\%; 3.3 μg m−3) and it is characterized by high proportions from lignin pyrolysis products from the combustion of hardwood. Another interesting feature lies in the separation of two fossil fuel combustion processes (FF1 and FF2): FF1 likely dominated by traffic emissions, while FF2 likely linked with the harbor/industrial activities. On annual average, the major contributors to PM2.5 mass correspond to the ammonium sulfate-rich aerosol (AS-rich, 30\%) and to the biomass burning emissions (BB1 + BB2, 23\%). This study also outlined that during high PM pollution episodes (PM2.5 {$>$} 25 μg m−3), the largest contributing sources to PM2.5 were biomass burning (33\%) and FF1 (23\%). Moreover, 28\% of the ambient mass concentration of OC is apportioned by the AS-rich factor, which is representative of an aged secondary aerosol, reflecting thus the importance of the oxidative processes occurring in a Mediterranean environment.},

  abstract = {Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is leading to various respiratory health outcomes. Compared to coarse and fine particles, less is known about the effects of chronic exposure to ultrafine particles, despite their higher number and reactivity. In the present study, we performed a time-course experiment in mice to better analyze the lung impact of atmospheric ultrafine particles, with regard to the effects induced by fine particles collected on the same site. Trace element and PAH analysis demonstrated the almost similar chemical composition of both particle fractions. Mice were exposed intranasally to FF or UFP according to acute (10, 50 or 100 \&micro;g of PM) and repeated (10 \&micro;g of PM 3 times a week during 1 or 3 months) exposure protocols. More particle-laden macrophages and even greater chronic inflammation were observed in the UFP-exposed mice lungs. Histological analyses revealed that about 50\% of lung tissues were damaged in mice exposed to UFP for three months versus only 35\% in FF-exposed mice. These injuries were characterized by alveolar wall thickening, macrophage infiltrations, and cystic lesions. Taken together, these results strongly motivate the update of current regulations regarding ambient PM concentrations to include UFP and limit their emission.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The primary sugar compounds (SCs, defined as glucose, arabitol, and mannitol) are widely recognized as suitable molecular markers to characterize and apportion primary biogenic organic aerosol emission sources. This work improves our understanding of the spatial behavior and distribution of these chemical species and evidences their major effective environmental drivers. We conducted a large study focusing on the daily (24\&thinsp;h) PM\textsubscript{10} SC concentrations for 16 increasing space scale sites (local to nationwide), over at least 1 complete year. These sites are distributed in several French geographic areas of different environmental conditions. Our analyses, mainly based on the examination of the short-term evolutions of SC concentrations, clearly show distance-dependent correlations. SC concentration evolutions are highly synchronous at an urban city scale and remain well correlated throughout the same geographic regions, even if the sites are situated in different cities. However, sampling sites located in two distinct geographic areas are poorly correlated. Such a pattern indicates that the processes responsible for the evolution of the atmospheric SC concentrations present a spatial homogeneity over typical areas of at least tens of kilometers. Local phenomena, such as the resuspension of topsoil and associated microbiota, do no account for the major emissions processes of SC in urban areas not directly influenced by agricultural activities. The concentrations of SC and cellulose display remarkably synchronous temporal evolution cycles at an urban site in Grenoble, indicating a common source ascribed to vegetation. Additionally, higher concentrations of SC at another site located in a crop field region occur during each harvest periods, indicating resuspension processes of plant materials (crop detritus, leaf debris) and associated microbiota for agricultural and nearby urbanized areas. Finally, ambient air temperature, relative humidity, and vegetation density constitute the main effective drivers of SC atmospheric concentrations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Airborne particles (called « PM » for Particulate matter") are nowadays at the core of societal concerns because of their major impact on public health and their strong participation in climate change. Organic matter (OM) generally represents the first mass component of PM but it is still poorly understood, in particular the organic fraction from primary biogenic origin (PBOA). Some specific primary sugars are proposed as molecular tracers to study the atmospheric transport processes as well as to estimate the contribution of PBOAs to the total mass of PM. However, knowledge is still very limited about their spatial and temporal distributions (i.e., daily, seasonal and annual cycles), their main emission sources, or the environmental factors that drive their atmospheric concentrations. Moreover, although the understanding of the oxidative potential (OP) —a proxy of the health effect of PM— inherent in the chemical component of aerosols has progressed quite well in recent years, the contribution of this PBOA fraction is still very poorly understood. These aspects constitute the main objectives of this thesis work. From a methodological point of view, our questions were addressed by an interdisciplinary approach, which involved the statistical exploitation of a large database and the coupling of specific field campaigns with the implementation of an innovative experimental strategy developed for the simultaneous study of the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the samples collected.In a first work based on the exploitation of a large database, we showed that PBOAs constitute a very important fraction of PM in France, regardless of the typology of the environment, contributing on average to 13 ± 4\% of the annual MO in PM10. We observed a synchronous temporal trends in both concentrations and ratios between primary sugars species for sites located in the same geographical region (up to an inter-site distance of about 200 km). These observations indicate that the PBOA source is very spatially homogeneous over distances consistent with those of large ecosystem types. This observation was then validated by an experimental approach based on two annual field sampling studies that allowed us to demonstrate (i) that daily changes in atmospheric concentrations of primary sugars are drived by only a few regionally variable atmospheric microbial taxa; and (ii) that these taxa come from local and regional flora for study sites that are directly influenced and not by agricultural activities, respectively. Finally, in the framework of the OP study, our results demonstrated (i) that all the tested model bioaerosols have a significant intrinsic OP, which is comparable for some species to the model atmospheric chemical components known for their high redox reactivity; and (ii) that they can significantly influence the OP of chemical PM models or sampled under real ambient conditions.This work provides a different look into the mass importance of PBOAs and new insights into the dominant sources and processes leading to their introduction into the atmosphere, as well as the influence of environmental factors on these processes. Alltogether these results argue for a systematic consideration of PBOAs in atmospheric chemistry models for better prediction of air quality.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Primary biogenic organic aerosols (PBOAs) represent a major fraction of coarse organic matter (OM) in air. Despite their implication in many atmospheric processes and human health problems, we surprisingly know little about PBOA characteristics (i.e., composition, dominant sources, and contribution to airborne particles). In addition, specific primary sugar compounds (SCs) are generally used as markers of PBOAs associated with bacteria and fungi, but our knowledge of microbial communities associated with atmospheric particulate matter (PM) remains incomplete. This work aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the microbial fingerprints associated with SCs in PM\textsubscript{10} (particles smaller than 10\&thinsp;µm) and their main sources in the surrounding environment (soils and vegetation). An intensive study was conducted on PM\textsubscript{10} collected at a rural background site located in an agricultural area in France. We combined high-throughput sequencing of bacteria and fungi with detailed physicochemical characterizations of PM\textsubscript{10}, soil, and plant samples and monitored meteorological and agricultural activities throughout the sampling period. Results show that in summer SCs in PM\textsubscript{10} are a major contributor of OM in air, representing 0.8\&thinsp;\% to 13.5\&thinsp;\% of OM mass. SC concentrations are clearly determined by the abundance of only a few specific airborne fungal and bacterial taxa. The temporal fluctuations in the abundance of only four predominant fungal genera, namely \emph{Cladosporium}, \emph{Alternaria}, \emph{Sporobolomyces}, and \emph{Dioszegia}, reflect the temporal dynamics in SC concentrations. Among bacterial taxa, the abundance of only \emph{Massilia}, \emph{Pseudomonas}, \emph{Frigoribacterium}, and \emph{Sphingomonas} is positively correlated with SC species. These microbes are significantly enhanced in leaf over soil samples. Interestingly, the overall community structure of bacteria and fungi are similar within PM\textsubscript{10} and leaf samples and significantly distinct between PM\textsubscript{10} and soil samples, indicating that surrounding vegetation is the major source of SC-associated microbial taxa in PM\textsubscript{10} in this rural area of France.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} A growing number of studies are using specific primary sugar species, such as sugar alcohols or primary saccharides, as marker compounds to characterize and apportion primary biogenic organic aerosols (PBOAs) in the atmosphere. To better understand their annual cycles, as well as their spatiotemporal abundance in terms of concentrations and sources, we conducted a large study focusing on three major atmospheric primary sugar compounds (i.e., arabitol, mannitol, and glucose) measured in various environmental conditions for about 5300 filter samples collected at 28 sites in France. Our results show significant atmospheric concentrations of polyols (defined here as the sum of arabitol and mannitol) and glucose at each sampling location, highlighting their ubiquity. Results also confirm that polyols and glucose are mainly associated with the coarse rather than the fine aerosol mode. At nearly all sites, atmospheric concentrations of polyols and glucose display a well-marked seasonal pattern, with maximum concentrations from late spring to early autumn, followed by an abrupt decrease in late autumn, and a minimum concentration during wintertime. Such seasonal patterns support biogenic emissions associated with higher biological metabolic activities (sporulation, growth, etc.) during warmer periods. Results from a previous comprehensive study using positive matrix factorization (PMF) based on an extended aerosol chemical composition dataset of up to 130 species for 16 of the same sample series have also been used in the present work. The polyols-to-PM\textsubscript{PBOA} ratio is 0.024±0.010 on average for all sites, with no clear distinction between traffic, urban, or rural typology. Overall, even if the exact origin of the PBOA source is still under investigation, it appears to be an important source of particulate matter (PM), especially during summertime. Results also show that PBOAs are significant sources of total organic matter (OM) in PM\textsubscript{10} (13±4\&thinsp;\% on a yearly average, and up to 40\&thinsp;\% in some environments in summer) at most of the investigated sites. The mean PBOA chemical profile is clearly dominated by contribution from OM (78±9\&thinsp;\% of the mass of the PBOA PMF on average), and only a minor contribution from the dust class (3±4\&thinsp;\%), suggesting that ambient polyols are most likely associated with biological particle emissions (e.g., active spore discharge) rather than soil dust resuspension.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter has been proposed as a toxicologically relevant metric. This concept is already frequently used for hazard characterization of ambient particles but it is still seldom applied in the occupational field. The objective of this study was to assess the OP in two different types of workplaces and to investigate the relationship between the OP and the physicochemical characteristics of the collected particles. At a toll station, at the entrance of a tunnel (‘Tunnel’ site), and at three different mechanical yards (‘Depot’ sites), we assessed particle mass (PM4 and PM2.5 and size distribution), number and surface area, organic and elemental carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and four quinones as well as iron and copper concentration. The OP was determined directly on filters without extraction by using the dithiothreitol assay (DTT assay-OPDTT). The averaged mass concentration of respirable particles (PM4) at the Tunnel site was about twice the one at the Depot sites (173\,±\,103 and 90\,±\,36 µg m−3, respectively), whereas the OPDTT was practically identical for all the sites (10.6\,±\,7.2 pmol DTT min−1 μg−1 at the Tunnel site; 10.4\,±\,4.6 pmol DTT min−1 μg−1 at the Depot sites). The OPDTT of PM4 was mostly present on the smallest PM2.5 fraction (OPDTT PM2.5: 10.2\,±\,8.1 pmol DTT min−1 μg−1; OPDTT PM4: 10.5\,±\,5.8 pmol DTT min−1 μg−1 for all sites), suggesting the presence of redox inactive components in the PM2.5–4 fraction. Although the reactivity was similar at the Tunnel and Depot sites irrespective of the metric chosen (OPDTT µg−1 or OPDTT m−3), the chemicals associated with OPDTT were different between the two types of workplaces. The organic carbon, quinones, and/or metal content (Fe, Cu) were strongly associated with the DTT reactivity at the Tunnel site whereas only Fe and PAH were associated (positively and negatively, respectively) with this reactivity at the Depot sites. These results demonstrate the feasibility of measuring of the OPDTT in occupational environments and suggest that the particulate OPDTT is integrative of different physicochemical properties. This parameter could be a potentially useful exposure proxy for investigating particle exposure-related oxidative stress and its consequences. Further research is needed mostly to demonstrate the association of OPDTT with relevant oxidative endpoints in humans exposed to particles.},

  abstract = {Background: Nanoparticle (NPs) functionalization has been shown to affect their cellular toxicity. To study this, differently functionalized silver (Ag) and gold (Au) NPs were synthesised, characterised and tested using lung epithelial cell systems.
Methods: Monodispersed Ag and Au NPs with a size range of 7 to 10 nm were coated with either sodium citrate or chitosan resulting in surface charges from −50 mV to +70 mV. NP-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were determined using A549 cells, BEAS-2B cells and primary lung epithelial cells (NHBE cells). TEER measurements and immunofluorescence staining of tight junctions were performed to test the growth characteristics of the cells. Cytotoxicity was measured by means of the CellTiter-Blue ® and the lactate dehydrogenase assay and cellular and cell-free reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured using the DCFH-DA assay.
Results: Different growth characteristics were shown in the three cell types used. A549 cells grew into a confluent mono-layer, BEAS-2B cells grew into a multilayer and NHBE cells did not form a confluent layer. A549 cells were least susceptible towards NPs, irrespective of the NP functionalization. Cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B cells increased when exposed to high positive charged (+65-75 mV) Au NPs. The greatest cytotoxicity was observed in NHBE cells, where both Ag and Au NPs with a charge above +40 mV induced cytotoxicity. ROS production was most prominent in A549 cells where Au NPs (+65-75 mV) induced the highest amount of ROS. In addition, cell-free ROS measurements showed a significant increase in ROS production with an increase in chitosan coating.
Conclusions: Chitosan functionalization of NPs, with resultant high surface charges plays an important role in NP-toxicity. Au NPs, which have been shown to be inert and often non-cytotoxic, can become toxic upon coating with certain charged molecules. Notably, these effects are dependent on the core material of the particle, the cell type used for testing and the growth characteristics of these cell culture model systems.},

Trace metals, soluble ions, carbon species total carbon (TC), elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), anhydrosugars, polar and non-polar trace organics, cellulose and humiclike substances (HULIS) have been measured. The inorganic and most organic components were not significantly different for the different woods, so that one profile could be derived for CMB modelling. The anhydrosugar levoglucosan was present in high concentrations, 4–15\% w/w, and for the mix of woods important for Austria, one conversion factor can be used to derive the mass of woodsmoke from the levoglucosan concentration in ambient air. Mannosan is also a major component, 0.3–4\% w/w, which, taken together with the levoglucosan content, permits estimates to be made of the proportion of hard- and softwood smoke to ambient PM.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric pollution in megacities has a major impact on human health and environmental quality. Air quality bioindicators may have some advantages over standard devices such as impactors or filters. In this study we evaluated the reliability of Tillandsia sp. versus passive filters for monitoring the atmospheric deposition of metal(loid)s in an area affected by anthropogenic activities. We aimed to gain insight into the composition and origin of atmospheric particles and their fate after deposition on the plant. Three zones with different contamination levels were monitored for five months in 2012. For the highly contaminated area, a linear increase in metal(loïd) accumulation was found in passive filters, whereas for transplanted Tillandsia capillaris the increase was almost linear for As, Cd, Hg, and Sn, but not for Ag, Pb, Sb, and Zn. For the moderately contaminated zone, the results showed that the exposure time was not sufficient for metal(loid) concentrations to increase in either the plants or filters. However, natural specimens provided some indications of the levels of metal contamination. Metal particles were observed on the plant surface and also in the central disc underneath tillandsia trichomes, suggesting that this is a possible pathway for metals to enter the plant. X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated chemical transformation for Pb and As, both in filters and plants. For Pb, sorbed Pb and/or cell wall complexes were identified in the plants. No AsIII-S species, indicative of As detoxification, were identified in the plant. Arsenic was oxidized from AsIII to AsV in both plants and filters. Thus, in the present study, passive filters proved more reliable than T. capillaris transplants, although natural specimens provided some insights into local contamination. Particulate contaminants underwent chemical transformation after being trapped in the plant, but there was no clear evidence of internalization and detoxification.},

A literature study has been conducted and emission fluxes have been calculated based on 35 fungal spore concentration datasets. Biome area data has been derived from the World Resource Institute. Several assumptions and simplifications needed to be adopted while aggregating the data: results from different measurement methods have been treated equally, while diurnal and seasonal cycles have been neglected. Moreover flux data were aggregated to very coarse biome areas due to scarcity of data. Results show number fluxes per square meter and second of 194 for tropical and subtropical forests, 203 for all other forests, 1203 for shrub, 2509 for crop, 8 for tundra, and 165 for grassland. No data were found for land ice. The annual mean global fluxes amount to 1.69 × 10\textsuperscript{\&ndash;11} kg m\textsuperscript{−2} s\textsuperscript{−1} as the best estimates, and 9.01 × 10\textsuperscript{\&ndash;12} kg m\textsuperscript{−2} s\textsuperscript{−1} and 3.28 × 10\textsuperscript{\&ndash;11} kg m\textsuperscript{−2} s\textsuperscript{−1} as the low and high estimate, respectively.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

From April–July 2012, we collected PM from roadside canyon, roadside motorway, and background urban sites in each of six European cities and from three rural sites spanning the continent. A Hi-Vol sampler was used to collect PM in three size classes (PM

              ) and PM was characterized for total elements, and oxidative activity quantified in unfiltered and filtered PM extracts. We measured a remarkable uniformity in air concentrations of ROS and especially DTT activity across the continent. Only a 4-fold difference was documented for DTT across the urban sites and a similar variance was documented for ROS, implying that chemical drivers of oxidative activity are relatively similar between sites. The ROS and DTT specific activity was greater at urban background sites (and also rural sites) than at urban canyon locations. PM
              3
              dominated the size distribution of both ROS activity (86\% of total) and DTT activity (76\% of total), reflecting both the large contribution of PM

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} We investigated spatial and temporal patterns in concentration and composition of sub-micron particulate matter (PM\textsubscript{1}) in Oakland, California in the summer of 2017 using an aerosol mass spectrometer mounted in a mobile laboratory. We performed ∼160 hours of mobile sampling in the city over a 20-day period. Measurements are compared for three adjacent neighborhoods with distinct land uses: a central business district ({$<$}q{$>$}downtown{$<$}/q{$>$}), a residential district ({$<$}q{$>$}West Oakland{$<$}/q{$>$}), and a major shipping port. The average organic aerosol (OA) concentration is 5.3μgm\textsuperscript{\&minus;3} and contributes ∼50\% of the PM\textsubscript{1} mass. OA concentrations in downtown are, on average, 1.5μgm\textsuperscript{\&minus;3} higher than in West Oakland and Port. We decomposed OA into three factors using positive matrix factorization: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA; 20\% average contribution), cooking OA (COA; 25\%) and semi-volatile oxidized OA (SV-OOA; 55\%). The collective 45\% contribution from primary OA (HOA + COA) emphasizes the importance of primary emissions in Oakland. The dominant source of primary OA shifts from HOA-rich in the morning to COA-rich after lunch time. COA in downtown is consistently higher than West Oakland and Port due to a large number of restaurants. HOA exhibits variability in space and time. Morning-time HOA concentration in downtown is twice that in Port, but Port HOA increases more than two-fold during mid-day, likely because trucking activity at the Port peaks at that time. Despite the expectation of being spatially uniform, SV-OOA also exhibits spatial differences. Morning-time SV-OOA in downtown is roughly 25\% (∼0.6μgm\textsuperscript{\&minus;3}) higher than the rest of Oakland. Even as the entire domain approaches a more uniform photo-chemical state in the afternoon, downtown SV-OOA remains statistically higher than West Oakland and Port, suggesting that downtown is a microenvironment with higher photochemical activity. Higher concentrations of particulate sulfate (also of secondary origin) with no direct sources in Oakland further reflect higher photochemical activity in downtown. A combination of several factors (poor ventilation of air masses in street canyons, higher concentrations of precursor gases, higher concentrations of the hydroxyl radical) likely result in the proposed high photochemical activity in downtown. Lastly, through Van Krevelen analysis of elemental ratios (H/C, O/C) of the OA, we show that OA in Oakland is more chemically reduced than several other urban areas. This underscores the importance of primary emissions in Oakland. We also show that mixing of oceanic air masses with these primary emissions in Oakland is an important processing mechanism that governs the overall OA composition in Oakland. The findings of this study are important because the pollutants we find contributing the most to OA variability, both of primary and secondary origin, are ubiquitous in other urban locations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The evaluation of oxidative potential in a physiologically relevant environment is always challenging. In this work, we developed a chromatographic method, employing an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a triple–quadruple mass spectrometer, to determine the oxidative potential of PM from different sources. To this purpose, we measured the PM-induced oxidation of glutathione, cysteine, and ascorbic acid, and formation of glutathione disulfide and cystine, following PM addition to simulated epithelial lining fluids, which, in addition to the antioxidants, contained inorganic salts, a phospholipid, and proteins. The new method showed high precision and, when applied to standard reference PM, the oxidative potential was found to increase with the reaction time and PM concentration in the lung fluid. The antioxidant depletion rates were considerably higher than the rates found with the conventional dithiothreitol assay, indicating the higher sensitivity of the new method. The presence of the lung fluid inorganic species increased the oxidative potential determined through glutathione and cysteine, but showed an opposite effect with ascorbic acid, whereas the presence of proteins resulted in a moderate decrease in the oxidative potential. In the presence of PM\textsubscript{2.5}, glutathione and cysteine demonstrated similar depletion patterns, which were noticeably different from that of ascorbic acid, suggesting that cysteine could be used as an alternative to glutathione for probing oxidative potential.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Poor air quality is globally the largest environmental health risk. Epidemiological studies have uncovered clear relationships of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter (PM) with adverse health outcomes, including mortality by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Studies of health impacts by aerosols are highly multidisciplinary with a broad range of scales in space and time. We assess recent advances and future challenges regarding aerosol effects on health from molecular to global scales through epidemiological studies, field measurements, health-related properties of PM, and multiphase interactions of oxidants and PM upon respiratory deposition. Global modeling combined with epidemiological exposure-response functions indicates that ambient air pollution causes more than four million premature deaths per year. Epidemiological studies usually refer to PM mass concentrations, but some health effects may relate to specific constituents such as bioaerosols, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and transition metals. Various analytical techniques and cellular and molecular assays are applied to assess the redox activity of PM and the formation of reactive oxygen species. Multiphase chemical interactions of lung antioxidants with atmospheric pollutants are crucial to the mechanistic and molecular understanding of oxidative stress upon respiratory deposition. The role of distinct PM components in health impacts and mortality needs to be clarified by integrated research on various spatiotemporal scales for better evaluation and mitigation of aerosol effects on public health in the Anthropocene.},

Concentrations of leachable V, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Cu were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. , Results: Both PM fractions elicited •OH generation as well as 8-OHdG formation in calf thymus DNA and in A549 cells. 8-OHdG formation in the naked DNA was significantly related to •OH generation, but not to metal concentrations except for copper. A significantly higher •OH generation was observed for coarse PM, but not fine PM collected during the autumn/winter season; this was not due to differences in sampled mass or metal content. Specific weather conditions under which increased •OH formation in the coarse mode was observed suggest that other, as yet unknown, anthropogenic components might affect the radical generating capacity of PM. , Conclusions: Both coarse and fine PM are able to generate •OH, and induce formation of 8-OHdG. When considered at equal mass, •OH formation shows considerable variability with regard to the fraction of PM, as well as the sampling season. The toxicological implications of this heterogeneity in •OH formation by PM, as can be easily determined by ESR, need further investigation.},

Elemental (Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Te, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, W, Tl, Pb, Bi and U) and ionic (Cl−, NO3−, SO42−, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) composition of the same samples was also determined, in order to trace the contribution of the main PM sources. The size distribution of the OP values was compared to the size distribution of some PM source tracers, with the aim of identifying the PM sources that mostly influence the oxidative properties of atmospheric dust. AA assay resulted to be more sensitive towards coarse particles and OPAA showed a size distribution very similar to that of brake dust tracers. DTT and DCFH assays resulted instead more sensitive towards fine particles. OPDTT and OPDCFH values were comparable at the two sites; sources whose strength was very different in the two monitored areas (secondary contribution and, to a less extent, industrial sources) did not then contribute significantly to the measured OP values. The dimensional behaviour of OPDTT and OPDCFH was consistent with the contribution of biomass burning.},

  abstract = {Titanium-dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are increasingly released in agricultural soils through, e.g. biosolids, irrigation or nanoagrochemicals. Soils are submitted to a wide range of concentrations of TiO2-NPs depending on the type of exposure. However, most studies have assessed the effects of unrealistically high concentrations, and the dose–response relationships are not well characterized for soil microbial communities. Here, using soil microcosms, we assessed the impact of TiO2-NPs at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 500 mg kgÀ1 dry-soil, on the activity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrobacter and Nitrospira). In addition, aggregation and oxidative potential of TiO2-NPs were measured in the spiking suspensions, as they can be important drivers of TiO2-NPs toxicity. After 90 days of exposure, non-classical dose–response relationships were observed for nitrifier abundance or activity, making threshold concentrations impossible to compute. Indeed, AOA abundance was reduced by 40\% by TiO2-NPs whatever the concentration, while Nitrospira was never affected. Moreover, AOB and Nitrobacter abundances were decreased mainly at intermediate concentrations nitrification was reduced by 25\% at the lowest (0.05 mg kgÀ1) and the highest (100 and 500 mg kgÀ1) TiO2-NPs concentrations. Path analyses indicated that TiO2-NPs affected nitrification through an effect on the specific activity of nitrifiers, in addition to indirect effects on nitrifier abundances. Altogether these results point out the need to include very low concentrations of NPs in soil toxicological studies, and the lack of relevance of classical dose–response tests and ecotoxicological dose metrics (EC50, IC50 … ) for TiO2-NPs impact on soil microorganisms.},

Filter and slurry PM2.5 samples were collected during warm (spanning from mid-August 2019 to early-September 2019) and cold (from mid-December 2019 to early-January 2020) seasons at an urban site in central Los Angeles. The collected samples were chemically analyzed for their total organic carbon (TOC) as well as individual organic species, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes and steranes, n-alkanes, and organic acids. In addition, the oxidative potential of PM2.5 samples was quantified by means of the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) in vitro assay. Overall, our findings revealed a very good agreement between the mass fractions of organic compounds in the collected PM2.5 slurries and filters, judging by the average slurry-to -filter ratios of 1.17 ± 0.15, 1.13 ± 0.14, 1.13 ± 0.15, and 1.16 ± 0.22 for PAHs, hopanes and steranes, n-alkanes, and organic acids, respectively. Moreover, comparable (Pvalue = 0.2) oxidative potential levels were observed between the collected filters and PM2.5 liquid suspensions. The aqueous PM suspensions collected by the VACES/aerosol-into-liquid collector exhibited slightly higher (although not statistically significant) capture of some semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), probably due to less sampling artifacts and better preservation of these SVOCs collected directly into aqueous suspensions compared to the filter samplers. The outcomes of this study confirm the efficient collection of PM-bound organic species in aqueous slurries by the aerosol-into-liquid collector, further corroborating the ability of this sampler to be used as an attractive alternative to filter samplers for collection of PM2.5 for toxicological studies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) may play an important role in aerosol–climate interactions, in particular by affecting ice formation in mixed phase clouds. However, the role of PBAPs is poorly understood because the sources and distribution of PBAPs in the atmosphere are not well quantified. Here we include emissions of fungal spores and bacteria in a global aerosol microphysics model and explore their contribution to concentrations of supermicron particle number, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and immersion freezing rates. Simulated surface annual mean concentrations of fungal spores are \textasciitilde{} 2.5 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{4} m\textsuperscript{−3} over continental midlatitudes and 1 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{5} m\textsuperscript{−3} over tropical forests. Simulated surface concentrations of bacteria are 2.5 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{4} m\textsuperscript{−3} over most continental regions and 5 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{4} m\textsuperscript{−3} over grasslands of central Asia and North America. These simulated surface number concentrations of fungal spores and bacteria are broadly in agreement with the limited available observations. We find that fungal spores and bacteria contribute 8 and 5\% respectively to simulated continental surface mean supermicron number concentrations, but have very limited impact on CCN concentrations, altering regional concentrations by less than 1\%. In agreement with previous global modelling studies, we find that fungal spores and bacteria contribute very little (3 \&times; 10\textsuperscript{−3}\%, even when we assume upper limits for ice nucleation activity) to global average immersion freezing ice nucleation rates, which are dominated by soot and dust. However, at lower altitudes (400 to 600 hPa), where warmer temperatures mean that soot and dust may not nucleate ice, we find that PBAP controls the immersion freezing ice nucleation rate. This demonstrates that PBAPs can be of regional importance for IN formation, in agreement with case study observations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The health effects of airborne fine particles are the subject of government regulation and scientific debate. The aerodynamics of airborne particulate matter, the deposition patterns in the human lung, and the available experimental and epidemiological data on health effects lead us to focus on airborne particulate matter with an aerodynamic mean diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) as the fraction of the particles with the largest impact in health. In this article we present a novel hypothesis to explain the continuous production of reactive oxygen species produced by PM2.5 when it is deposited in the lung. We find PM2.5 contains abundant persistent free radicals, typically 1016 to 1017 unpaired spins/gram, and that these radicals are stable for several months. These radicals are consistent with the stability and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral characteristics of semiquinone radicals. Catalytic redox cycling by semiquinone radicals is well documented in the literature and we had studied in detail its role on the health effects of cigarette smoke particulate matter. We believe that we have for the first time shown that the same, or similar radicals, are not confined to cigarette smoke particulate matter but are also present in PM2.5. We hypothesize that these semiquinone radicals undergo redox cycling, thereby reducing oxygen and generating reactive oxygen species while consuming tissue-reducing equivalents, such as NAD(P)H and ascorbate. These reactive oxygen species generated by particles cause oxidative stress at sites of deposition and produce deleterious effects observed in the lung.},

  abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is known to account for a major fraction of airborne particulate matter, with significant impacts on air quality and climate at the global scale. Despite the substantial amount of research studies achieved during these last decades, the source apportionment of the SOA fraction remains difficult due to the complexity of the physicochemical processes involved. The selection and use of appropriate approaches are a major challenge for the atmospheric science community. Several methodologies are nowadays available to perform quantitative and/or predictive assessments of the SOA amount and composition. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the most commonly used approaches to evaluate secondary organic carbon (SOC) contents: elemental carbon (EC) tracer method, chemical mass balance (CMB), SOA tracer method, radiocarbon (14C) measurement and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The principles, limitations, challenges and good practices of each of these methodologies are discussed in the present article. Based on a comprehensive\&mdash;although not exhaustive\&mdash;review of research papers published during the last decade (2006\&ndash;2016), SOC estimates obtained using these methodologies are also summarized for different regions across the world. Conclusions of some studies which are directly comparing the performances of different methodologies are then specifically discussed. An overall picture of SOC contributions and concentrations obtained worldwide for urban sites under similar conditions (i.e., geographical and seasonal ones) is also proposed here. Finally, further needs to improve SOC apportionment methodologies are also identified and discussed.},

  abstract = {The present study proposes an advanced methodology to refine the source apportionment of organic aerosol (OA). This methodology is based on the combination of offline and online datasets in a single Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis using the multilinear engine (ME-2) algorithm and a customized time synchronization procedure. It has been applied to data from measurements conducted in the Paris region (France) during a PM pollution event in March 2015. Measurements included OA ACSM (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor) mass spectra and specific primary and secondary organic molecular markers from PM10 filters on their original time resolution (30 min for ACSM and 4 h for PM10 filters). Comparison with the conventional PMF analysis of the ACSM OA dataset (PMF-ACSM) showed very good agreement for the discrimination between primary and secondary OA fractions with about 75\% of the OA mass of secondary origin. Furthermore, the use of the combined datasets allowed the deconvolution of 3 primary OA (POA) factors and 7 secondary OA (SOA) factors. A clear identification of the source/origin of 54\% of the total SOA mass could be achieved thanks to specific molecular markers. Specifically, 28\% of that fraction was linked to combustion sources (biomass burning and traffic emissions). A clear identification of primary traffic OA was also obtained using the PMF-combined analysis while PMF-ACSM only gave a proxy for this OA source in the form of total hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) mass concentrations. In addition, the primary biomass burning-related OA source was explained by two OA factors, BBOA and OPOA-like BBOA. This new approach has showed undeniable advantages over the conventional approaches by providing valuable insights into the processes involved in SOA formation and their sources. However, the origins of highly oxidized SOA could not be fully identified due to the lack of specific molecular markers for such aged SOA.},

  abstract = {Background: Cohorts based on administrative data have size advantages over individual cohorts in investigating air pollution risks, but often lack in-depth information on individual risk factors related to lifestyle. If there is a correlation between lifestyle and air pollution, omitted lifestyle variables may result in biased air pollution risk estimates. Correlations between lifestyle and air pollution can be induced by socio-economic status affecting both lifestyle and air pollution exposure.
Objectives: Our overall aim was to assess potential confounding by missing lifestyle factors on air pollution mortality risk estimates. The first aim was to assess associations between long-term exposure to several air pollutants and lifestyle factors. The second aim was to assess whether these associations were sensitive to adjustment for individual and area-level socioeconomic status (SES), and whether they differed between subgroups of the population. Using the obtained air pollution–lifestyle associations and indirect adjustment methods, our third aim was to investigate the potential bias due to missing lifestyle information on air pollution mortality risk estimates in administrative cohorts.
Methods: We used a recent Dutch national health survey of 387,195 adults to investigate the associations of PM10, PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM2.5 absorbance, OPDTT, OPESR and NO2 annual average concentrations at the residential address from land use regression models with individual smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity and body mass index. We assessed the associations with and without adjustment for neighborhood and individual SES characteristics typically available in administrative data cohorts. We illustrated the effect of including lifestyle information on the air pollution mortality risk estimates in administrative cohort studies using a published indirect adjustment method.
Results: Current smoking and alcohol consumption were generally positively associated with air pollution. Physical activity and overweight were negatively associated with air pollution. The effect estimates were small (mostly {$<$} 5\% of the air pollutant standard deviations). Direction and magnitude of the associations depended on the pollutant, use of continuous vs. categorical scale of the lifestyle variable, and level of adjustment for individual and area-level SES. Associations further differed between subgroups (age, sex) in the population. Despite the small associations between air pollution and smoking intensity, indirect adjustment resulted in considerable changes of air pollution risk estimates for cardiovascular and especially lung cancer mortality.
Conclusions: Individual lifestyle-related risk factors were weakly associated with long-term exposure to air pollution in the Netherlands. Indirect adjustment for missing lifestyle factors in administrative data cohort studies may substantially affect air pollution mortality risk estimates.},

  abstract = {Background
The evidence from observational epidemiological studies of a link between long-term air pollution exposure and diabetes prevalence and incidence is currently mixed. Some studies found the strongest associations of diabetes with fine particles, other studies with nitrogen dioxide and some studies found no associations.
Objectives
Our aim was to investigate associations between long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants and diabetes prevalence in a large national survey in the Netherlands.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional analysis using the 2012 Dutch national health survey to investigate the associations between the 2009 annual average concentrations of multiple air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, PM10−2.5, PM2.5 absorbance, OPDTT, OPESR and NO2) and diabetes prevalence, among 289,703 adults. Air pollution exposure was assessed by land use regression models. Diabetes was defined based on a combined measure of self-reported physician diagnosis and medication prescription from an external database. Using logistic regression, we adjusted for potential confounders, including neighborhood- and individual socio-economic status and lifestyle-related risk factors such as smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity and BMI.
Results
After adjustment for potential confounders, all pollutants (except PM2.5) were associated with diabetes prevalence. In two-pollutant models, NO2 and OPDTT remained associated with increased diabetes prevalence. For NO2 and OPDTT, single-pollutant ORs per interquartile range were 1.07 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.09) and 1.08 (95\% CI: 1.05, 1.10), respectively. Stratified analysis showed no consistent effect modification by any of the included known diabetes risk factors.
Conclusions
Long-term residential air pollution exposure was associated with diabetes prevalence in a large health survey in the Netherlands, strengthening the evidence of air pollution being an important diabetes risk factor. Most consistent associations were observed for NO2 and oxidative potential of PM2.5 measured by the DTT assay. The finding of an association with the oxidative potential of fine particles but not with PM2.5, suggests that particle composition may be important for a potential effect on diabetes.},

Samples were analyzed for i) mass concentration; ii) elemental concentration; and iii) oxidative potential (OP) through antioxidant depletion. The PM2.5 mass concentration exceeded the annual mean guideline of 10 mg mÀ3 WHO in 50\% of the samples. Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations correlated almost linearly. Proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) spectrometry was used for the monitoring of 21 elements. Quantitative determination was achieved in the case of Teflon filters only for Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe and Zn at ng mÀ3 concentration level. Quartz fiber filters were less adequate for the PIXE measurements due to their greater thickness and filamentary structure. Ca, Cr, Zn and Ti had generally higher concentration (mg gÀ1) indoors. Indoor/ outdoor (I/O) OP values were higher than one in 14\% and 57\% of the samples in the case of ascorbate and reduced glutathione (GSH), respectively. Spatial and temporal variations of OP were observed across the office buildings. The I/O ratios for OP, Cr and Zn concentrations in the case of GSH were higher for three buildings. Significant relationship was observed between GSH oxidation and Cr and Zn concentrations. Thus, employees were exposed to a higher extent to reactive oxygen species in three buildings.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) may impact human health and aerosol-cloud-climate interactions. The role of PBAPs in the earth system is associated with large uncertainties, for example of source estimates and the atmospheric lifetime. We used a chemistry-climate model to simulate PBAPs in the atmosphere including bacteria and fungal spores. Three fungal spore emission parameterizations have been evaluated against an updated set of spore counts synthesized from observations reported in the literature. The comparison indicates an optimal fit for the emission parameterization proposed by Heald and Spracklen (2009) and adapted by Hoose et al. (2010) for particle sizes of 5\&thinsp;µm or 3\&thinsp;µm, although the model still overpredicts PBAP concentrations in some locations. The correlations between the spore count observations and meteorological parameters simulated by the model show a strong dependence on the leaf area index in non-urban areas and the specific humidity in urban areas. Additional evaluation was performed by comparing our combined bacteria and fungal spore simulations to a global dataset of fluorescent biological aerosol particle (FBAP) concentrations. The model predicts the total sum of measured PBAP concentrations relatively well, typically within a factor of two of FBAP. Further, the modeled fungal spore results deviate from the FBAP concentrations when used as a rough proxy for spores, depending on the particle size used in the parametrization. Uncertainties related to technical aspects of the FBAP and direct-counting spore measurements challenge the ability to further refine quantitative comparison on this scale. Additional long-term data of better quality are needed to improve emission parameterizations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {World Bank reports Delhi as a second most polluted megacity in the world for particulates pollution. In Delhi, PM10 (d ≤ 10 μm) aerosol samples were monitored throughout 2008 and their characterization for major chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Br, Sr, Ba, Pb, Cd, Sn and Sb) and ions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) have been documented in an earlier study. To resolve complexity in source apportionment for chemical constituents in PM10, UNMIX 6.0 and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF 3.0) models are applied. Four factors were derived to explain routine sources of PM10 (crustal origin, road-traffic and secondary aerosols). Factor-1, designated as road-traffic source, has been determined by temporal correlation among Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni and V with strong correlation between Pb and Zn. This source factor-1 has shown more than 60\% contribution to receptor site. Factor-2, referred as crustal origin due to strong inter-relationship among Si, Fe, Al, Ca and Mg, has also shown to be significant contribution to similar species in receptor matrix. Factor-3 (NH4+, NO3-) has been differentiated due to contribution of secondary aerosols in the receptor region. This factor-3 has indicated major fraction of these ionic species for their uniform percentage variability, where mean values have been projected close to 75th percentile. Surprisingly, source factor-4 has explained the specific chloride source in the region with major contribution of 86\%. For policymakers, results presented would serve as benchmark of source apportionments in Delhi.},

  abstract = {Selenium adsorption onto oxy-hydroxides mainly controls its mobility in volcanic soils, red earths and soils poor in organic matter (OM) while the influence of OM was emphasized in podzol and peat soils. This work aims at deciphering how those solid phases influence ambient Se mobility and speciation under less contrasted conditions in 26 soils spanning extensive ranges of OM (1–32\%), Fe/Al oxy-hydroxides (0.3–6.1\%) contents and pH (4.0–8.3). The soil collection included agriculture, meadow and forest soils to assess the influence of OM quality as well. Trace concentrations of six ambient Se species (Se(IV), Se(VI) and 4 organo-Se compounds) were analyzed by HPLC–ICP-MS in three extractants (ultrapure water, phosphate and sodium hydroxide) targeting Se associated to different soil phases. The Kd values determined from ultrapure water extraction were higher than those reported in commonly used short-term experiments after Se-spiking. Correlations of ambient Se content and distribution with soil parameters explained this difference by an involvement of slow processes in Se retention in soils. The 26 Kd values determined here for a wide variety of soils thus represent a relevant database for long-term prediction of Se mobility. For soils containing less than 20\% OM, ambient Se solubility is primarily controlled by its adsorption onto crystalline oxy-hydroxides. However, OM plays an important role in Se mobility by forming organo-mineral associations that may protect adsorbed Se from leaching and/or create anoxic zones (aggregates) where Se is immobilized after its reduction. Although for the first time, inorganic Se(IV), Se(VI) and organo-Se compounds were simultaneously investigated in a large soil collection, high Se proportions remain unidentified in each soil extract, most probably due to Se incorporation and/or binding to colloidal-sized OM. Variations of environmental factors regulating the extent of OM-mineral associations/aggregation may thus lead to changes in Se mobility and bio-availability.},

  abstract = {21 PAHs, 27 oxy-PAHs and 32 nitro-PAHs were measured every third day over a year in both gaseous (G) and particulate PM10 (P) phases in ambient air of Grenoble (France). Mean total concentrations (G+P) of PAHs and oxy-PAHs were in the same range and about 10ngm−3. Nitro-PAHs were 50 to 100 times less concentrated averaging 100pgm−3. Polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) concentrations were 5 to 7 times higher in “cold” period (October to March) than in “warm” period (April to September). Seasonal variations may be explained by higher primary emissions from residential heating, especially biomass burning in “cold” season. Meteorological conditions and influence of the geomorphology around Grenoble, with the formation of thermal inversion layers leading to the stagnation of pollutants, were additional key parameters. Maximum individual PAC concentrations were observed during two PM10 pollution events in December and February–March. Chemical processes and secondary formation of oxy- and nitro-PAH were probably enhanced by the accumulation of the pollutants during these events. PAC gas/particle partitioning depended on compound molecular weight and vapour pressure. Gas/particle partitioning of oxy- and nitro-PAHs were evaluated using a multi-phase poly-parameter linear free energy relationship model. The PAC cancer risk was assessed using toxic equivalency factors available in the literature (19 PAHs, 10 nitro-PAHs and 1 oxy-PAH). Overall, particle-bound PACs contributed about 76\% of the cancer risk. While PAHs accounted for most of the total PAC cancer risk, oxy- and nitro-PAHs could account for up to 24\%. The risk quantification across substance classes is limited by toxicological data availability.},

The results indicated that their concentrations were strongly affected by primary emissions in cold period, especially from residential heating (i.e. biomass burning). Besides, secondary processes occurred in summer but also in cold period under specific conditions such as during long thermal inversion layer periods and severe PM pollution events. Different secondary processes were involved during both PM pollution events observed in March–April and in December 2013. During the first one, long range transport of air masses, nitrate chemistry and secondary nitro-PAH formation seemed linked. During the second one, the accumulation of primary pollutants over several consecutive days enhanced secondary chemical processes notably highlighted by the dramatic increase of oxy-PAH concentrations. The study of the time trends of ratios of individual nitro- or oxy-PAHs to parent PAHs, in combination with key primary or secondary aerosol species and literature data, allowed the identification of potential molecular markers of PAH oxidation. Finally, 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one, biphenyl-2,2’-dicarboxaldehyde and 3-nitrophenanthrene have been selected to be the best candidates as markers of PAH oxidation processes in ambient air.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) exposure is a leading global human health risk. In this study, water-soluble oxidative potential (OP) and intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production were measured for open biomass burning aerosol collected from the Brazilian Amazon. Compared to ambient samples collected from Atlanta and laboratory-generated secondary organic aerosol (SOA), biomass burning aerosol had comparable OP and induced higher levels of ROS/RNS. Compared to regressed OP ranges for biomass burning factors resolved using source apportionment in prior studies, the samples investigated in this study spanned a wider OP range, suggesting that concentration addition may not be applicable for OP measurements. The discrepancy between ROS/RNS estimated using laboratory polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) solution mixtures and ROS/RNS measured for the water-soluble hydrophobic fraction of Amazon filter samples further supports this conclusion. These results have important implications as many previous studies are based on linear regressions that assume concentration addition. Finally, a significant correlation was observed between ROS/RNS and levoglucosan concentrations although exposure to pure solutions of levoglucosan induced negligible ROS/RNS. These results demonstrate that levoglucosan may be considered as a predictor for ROS/RNS even though concentration addition may not be an applicable mixture effect model.},

Chemical analysis of the water-soluble PM fraction included ionic species (NO3À, SO42À, ClÀ, Naþ, NH4þ, Kþ, Mg2þ, Ca2þ), watersoluble organic carbon (WSOC), and trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni, Zn, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Ca, and Mg). The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was employed for the abiotic assessment of the oxidative PM activity. Cytotoxic responses were investigated in vitro by applying the mitochondrial dehydrogenase (MTT) and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) bioassays on human lung cells (MRC-5), while DNA damage was estimated by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, known as Comet assay. The correlations between the observed bioactivity responses and the concentrations of water-soluble chemical PM constituents in the various size ranges were investigated.

  abstract = {Relative contributions of water- and methanol-soluble compounds and their hydrophobic/hydrophilic subfractions to the ROS (reactive oxygen species)-generating potential of ambient fine aerosols (Dp {$<$} 2.5 μm) are assessed. ROS-generating (or oxidative) potential of the particulate matter (PM) was measured by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Particles were collected on quartz filters (N = 8) at an urban site near central Atlanta during January−February 2012 using a PM2.5 high-volume sampler. Filter punches were extracted separately in both water and methanol. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions were then subsequently segregated via a C-18 solid phase extraction column. The DTT assay response was significantly higher for the methanol extract, and for both extracts a substantial fraction of PM oxidative potential was associated with the hydrophobic compounds as evident from a substantial attenuation in DTT response after passing PM extracts through the C-18 column (64\% for water and 83\% for methanol extract; both median values). The DTT activities of water and methanol extracts were correlated with the water-soluble (R = 0.86) and water-insoluble organic carbon (R = 0.94) contents of the PM, respectively. Brown carbon (BrC), which predominantly represents the hydrophobic organic fraction (referred to as humic-like substances, HULIS), was also correlated with DTT activity in both the water (R = 0.78) and methanol extracts (R = 0.83). Oxidative potential was not correlated with any metals measured in the extracts. These findings suggest that the hydrophobic components of both water-soluble and insoluble organic aerosols substantially contribute to the oxidative properties of ambient PM. Further investigation of these hydrophobic organic compounds could help identify sources of a significant fraction of ambient aerosol toxicity.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a technique to identify the redox-active components of fine organic aerosols by fractionating humic-like substances (HULIS). We applied this technique to a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay e a measure of the capability of PM to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and assessed the contribution of quinones to the DTT activity of ambient water-soluble PM. Filter samples from the Southeastern Center for Air Pollution \& Epidemiology (SCAPE) were extracted in water and then passed-through a C-18 column to isolate the HULIS fraction by retention on the column. The HULIS was then eluted with a sequence of solvents of increasing polarity, i.e., hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and then methanol. Each of these eluted fractions was analyzed for DTT activity. The methanol fraction was found to possess most of the DTT activity ({$>$}70\%), while the hexane fraction had the least activity ({$<$}5\%), suggesting that the ROS-active compounds of ambient water-soluble PM2.5 HULIS are mostly polar in nature. A number of quinones thought to contribute to ambient PM DTT activity were also tested. 1,4 Naphthoquinone (1,4 NQ), 1,2 Naphthoquinone (1,2 NQ), 9,10 Phenanthrenequinone (PQ), and 5-hydroxy-1,4 NQ were analyzed by the same protocol. The hexane fraction of two quinones (PQ, and 1,4 NQ) was the most-DTT active, while methanol was the least, confirming that PQ, 1,4 NQ, and 1,2 NQ (which could not be recovered from the column) do not contribute significantly to the water-soluble DTT activity of ambient PM2.5. However, an oxygenated derivative of 1,4 NQ, (5-hydroxy-1,4 NQ), which is also intrinsically more DTT-active than 1,4 NQ, was mostly ({$>$}60\%) eluted in methanol. The results demonstrate the importance of atmospheric aging (oxidation) of organic aerosols in enhancing the ROS activity of ambient PM.},

  abstract = {To characterize the redox activity profiles of atmospheric aerosols from primary (traffic) and secondary photochemical sources, ambient quasi-ultrafine particles were collected near downtown Los Angeles in two different time periods – morning (6:00–9:00 PDT) and afternoon (11:00–14:00 PDT) in the summer of 2008. Detailed chemical analysis of the collected samples, including water-soluble elements, inorganic ions, organic species and water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) was conducted and redox activity of the samples was measured by two different assays: the dithiothreitol (DTT) and the macrophage reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays. Tracers of secondary photochemical reactions, such as sulfate and organic acids were higher (2.1~±~0.6 times for sulfate, and up to 3 times for the organic acids) in the afternoon period. WSOC was also elevated by 2.5~±~0.9 times in the afternoon period due to photo-oxidation of primary particles during atmospheric aging. Redox activity measured by the DTT assay was considerably higher for the samples collected during the afternoon; on the other hand, diurnal trends in the ROS-based activity were not consistent between the morning and afternoon periods. A linear regression between redox activity and various PM chemical constituents showed that the DTT assay was highly correlated with WSOC (R2~=~0.80), while ROS activity was associated mostly with water soluble transition metals (Vanadium, Nickel and Cadmium; R2~{$>~$}0.70). The DTT and ROS assays, which are based on the generation of different oxidizing species by chemical PM constituents, provide important information for elucidating the health risks related to PM exposure from different sources. Thus, both primary and secondary particles possess high redox activity; however, photochemical transformations of primary emissions with atmospheric aging enhance the toxicological potency of primary particles in terms of generating oxidative stress and leading to subsequent damage in cells.},

Ship emissions have the potential to contribute to air quality degradation in coastal areas, in addition to contributing to global air pollution. With the aim to quantify the impacts of shipping emissions on urban air quality in coastal areas in Europe, an in depth literature review was carried out focussing on particulate matter and gaseous pollutants but also reviewing the main chemical tracers of shipping emissions, the particle size distribution of ship-derived particulates and their contributions to population exposure and atmospheric deposition. Mitigation strategies were also addressed. In European coastal areas, shipping emissions contribute with 1e7\% of ambient air PM10 levels, 1e14\% of PM2.5, and at least 11\% of PM1. Contributions from shipping to ambient NO2 levels range between 7 and 24\%, with the highest values being recorded in the Netherlands and Denmark. Impacts from shipping emissions on SO2 concentrations were reported for Sweden and Spain. Shipping emissions impact not only the levels and composition of particulate and gaseous pollutants, but may also enhance new particle formation processes in urban areas.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Carbonaceous aerosols are related to adverse human health effects. Therefore, identification of their sources and analysis of their chemical composition is important. The offline AMS (aerosol mass spectrometer) technique offers quantitative separation of organic aerosol (OA) factors which can be related to major OA sources, either primary or secondary. While primary OA can be more clearly separated into sources, secondary (SOA) source apportionment is more challenging because different sources – anthropogenic or natural, fossil or non-fossil – can yield similar highly oxygenated mass spectra. Radiocarbon measurements provide unequivocal separation between fossil and non-fossil sources of carbon. Here we coupled these two offline methods and analysed the OA and organic carbon (OC) of different size fractions (particulate matter below 10 and 2.5\&thinsp;µm – PM\textsubscript{10} and PM\textsubscript{2.5}, respectively) from the Alpine valley of Magadino (Switzerland) during the years 2013 and 2014 (219 samples). The combination of the techniques gave further insight into the characteristics of secondary OC (SOC) which was rather based on the type of SOC precursor and not on the volatility or the oxidation state of OC, as typically considered. Out of the primary sources separated in this study, biomass burning OC was the dominant one in winter, with average concentrations of 5.36\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;2.64\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3} for PM\textsubscript{10} and 3.83\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;1.81\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3} for PM\textsubscript{2.5}, indicating that wood combustion particles were predominantly generated in the fine mode. The additional information from the size-segregated measurements revealed a primary sulfur-containing factor, mainly fossil, detected in the coarse size fraction and related to non-exhaust traffic emissions with a yearly average PM\textsubscript{10} (PM\textsubscript{2.5}) concentration of 0.20\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.24\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3} (0.05\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.04\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3}). A primary biological OC (PBOC) was also detected in the coarse mode peaking in spring and summer with a yearly average PM\textsubscript{10} (PM\textsubscript{2.5}) concentration of 0.79\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.31\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3} (0.24\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;0.20\&thinsp;µg\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{−3}). The secondary OC was separated into two oxygenated, non-fossil OC factors which were identified based on their seasonal variability (i.e. summer and winter oxygenated organic carbon, OOC) and a third anthropogenic OOC factor which correlated with fossil OC mainly peaking in winter and spring, contributing on average 13\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;7\&thinsp;\% (10\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;9\&thinsp;\%) to the total OC in PM\textsubscript{10} (PM\textsubscript{2.5}). The winter OOC was also connected to anthropogenic sources, contributing on average 13\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;13\&thinsp;\% (6\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;6\&thinsp;\%) to the total OC in PM\textsubscript{10} (PM\textsubscript{2.5}). The summer OOC (SOOC), stemming from oxidation of biogenic emissions, was more pronounced in the fine mode, contributing on average 43\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;12\&thinsp;\% (75\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;44\&thinsp;\%) to the total OC in PM\textsubscript{10} (PM\textsubscript{2.5}). In total the non-fossil OC significantly dominated the fossil OC throughout all seasons, by contributing on average 75\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;24\&thinsp;\% to the total OC. The results also suggested that during the cold period the prevailing source was residential biomass burning while during the warm period primary biological sources and secondary organic aerosol from the oxidation of biogenic emissions became important. However, SOC was also formed by aged fossil fuel combustion emissions not only in summer but also during the rest of the year.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Bootstrap analysis is commonly used to capture the uncertainties of a bilinear receptor model such as the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. This approach can estimate the factor-related uncertainties and partially assess the rotational ambiguity of the model. The selection of the environmentally plausible solutions, though, can be challenging, and a systematic approach to identify and sort the factors is needed. For this, comparison of the factors between each bootstrap run and the initial PMF output, as well as with externally determined markers, is crucial. As a result, certain solutions that exhibit suboptimal factor separation should be discarded. The retained solutions would then be used to test the robustness of the PMF output. Meanwhile, analysis of filter samples with the Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer and the application of PMF and bootstrap analysis on the bulk water-soluble organic aerosol mass spectra have provided insight into the source identification and their uncertainties. Here, we investigated a full yearly cycle of the sources of organic aerosol (OA) at three sites in Estonia: Tallinn (urban), Tartu (suburban) and Kohtla-Järve (KJ; industrial). We identified six OA sources and an inorganic dust factor. The primary OA types included biomass burning, dominant in winter in Tartu and accounting for 73\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;21\&thinsp;\% of the total OA, primary biological OA which was abundant in Tartu and Tallinn in spring (21\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;8\&thinsp;\% and 11\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;5\&thinsp;\%, respectively), and two other primary OA types lower in mass. A sulfur-containing OA was related to road dust and tire abrasion which exhibited a rather stable yearly cycle, and an oil OA was connected to the oil shale industries in KJ prevailing at this site that comprises 36\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;14\&thinsp;\% of the total OA in spring. The secondary OA sources were separated based on their seasonal behavior: a winter oxygenated OA dominated in winter (36\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;14\&thinsp;\% for KJ, 25\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;9\&thinsp;\% for Tallinn and 13\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;5\&thinsp;\% for Tartu) and was correlated with benzoic and phthalic acid, implying an anthropogenic origin. A summer oxygenated OA was the main source of OA in summer at all sites (26\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;5\&thinsp;\% in KJ, 41\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;7\&thinsp;\% in Tallinn and 35\&thinsp;\%\&thinsp;±\&thinsp;7\&thinsp;\% in Tartu) and exhibited high correlations with oxidation products of \emph{a}-pinene-like pinic acid and 3-methyl-1, 2, 3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA), suggesting a biogenic origin.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Instrumental parameters of the SPME procedure were optimized to yield extraction efficiencies of up to 96\% from complex aqueous matrices. The effects of sample matrix composition and analyte transformation during sample storage were critically assessed. With the use of internal standards and procedural calibrations, the DI-SPME−GC/MS method allows for trace-level quantification of volatile Se and S compounds in the ng/L range (e.g. down to 30ng/L dimethyl sulfide and 75ng/L dimethyl selenide). The applicability and robustness of the presented method demonstrate that the method may be used to quantify volatile Se and S compounds in complex aqueous samples, such as industrial effluents or food and beverage samples.},

The two versions showed a good agreement with each other and with more accurate, computationally demanding methods. The off-line algorithm (Particulate Source Apportionment Technology, PSAT) is simpler to implement, has a lower computational cost and is suitable for a range of source apportionment studies. As a first application, PSAT was used to investigate the contribution of power plant SO2 emissions to particulate sulfate concentrations in the Eastern United States. The impact of the transport of SO2 emissions from the Chicago, IL area and the impact of these emissions on particulate sulfate concentration in surrounding areas were also studied as a second application. The implementation of PSAT for the SO2/particulate sulfate system only resulted in a 1\% increase in computation time over the base simulation. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient platform for the study of pollutant transport and source contributions on regional scales.},

The focus of this paper is on sulfate, nitrate, and elemental carbon. The objective of the TSSA algorithm is to provide useful results in modeling studies for identifying important emissions categories and identifying possible emissions reduction strategies to attain particulate matter (PM) air quality goals. TSSA differs from model sensitivity approaches because it tracks direct mass contributions from specific emissions sources to the total PM concentration at selected receptor sites, while results from sensitivity approaches are affected by nonlinear chemistry that can change the concentration of sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon secondary particulates. We evaluated the algorithm by comparing CMAQ/TSSA results with results from zero-out CMAQ sensitivity simulations. As expected, TSSA results were almost identical to the CMAQ sensitivity results for chemical species that do not undergo nonlinear chemical reactions. For chemical species with nonlinear chemical reaction, the TSSA results are expected to differ from model sensitivity results, but for small emissions changes the results are similar in the two approaches. We also compared CMAQ/TSSA to CAMx/PSAT. Because there are significant differences in the CMAQ and CAMx model predicted concentrations, the source attribution results differed for TSSA and PSAT; however, the rank order of emissions sources were similar for the two approaches at most receptor sites.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate with field data the benefit of using high-time-resolution chemical speciation data in achieving more robust source apportionment of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using positive matrix factorization (PMF). Hourly composition data were collected over a month in Shanghai, including four inorganic ions, 13 elements, organic, and elemental carbon. PMF analysis of the hourly data set (PMF1h) resolves eight factors: secondary nitrate/sulfate, vehicular/industrial emissions, coal combustion, secondary sulfate, tire wear, Cr and Ni point source, residual oil combustion, and dust, with the first three being the major ones and each contributing to {$>$}20\% of PM2.5 mass. To characterize the benefit gained from time resolution, we carried out separate PMF analyses of 4- and 6-hr averaged data of the same data set (PMF6h and PMF4h). PMF6h and PMF4h produce an eight-factor solution sharing similar factors to those by PMF1h but show less stability and more mixing in source profiles. Profile mixing was especially noticeable for tire wear, coal combustion, and Cr and Ni point source in PMF6h, as the 6-hr averaging significantly decreased between-sample variability and increased rotational ambiguity. While the three sets of PMF solutions were similar in contributions for factors with major species as source markers (e.g., secondary nitrate/sulfate), larger variations existed for factors with trace species as markers due to mixing of major species in the profiles and higher rotational uncertainties in PMF4h and PMF6h. Our results indicate that hourly time series of elements and major components could achieve more robust source apportionment through better capturing of diurnal-scale dynamics in source activities.},

The genesis potential index (GPI) and ventilation index (VI) are combinations of dynamic and thermodynamic variables that provide proxies for TC activity under different climate states. Here we use five CMIP5 models that have run the RCP4.5 experiment and the GeoMIP stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) G4 experiment to calculate the two TC indices over the 2020 to 2069 period across the six ocean basins that generate TCs. GPI is consistently and significantly lower under G4 than RCP4.5 in five out of six ocean basins, but it increases under G4 in the South Pacific. The models project potential intensity and relative humidity to be the dominant variables affecting GPI. Changes in vertical wind shear are significant, but it is correlated with relative humidity, though with different relations across both models and ocean basins. We find that tropopause temperature is not a useful addition to sea surface temperature (SST) in projecting TC genesis, perhaps because the earth system models (ESMs) vary in their simulation of the various upper-tropospheric changes induced by the aerosol injection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Inhaled aerosolized particulate matter (PM) induces cellular oxidative stress in vivo, leading to adverse health outcomes. The oxidative potential (OP) of PM appears to be a more relevant proxy of the health impact of the aerosol rather than the total mass concentration. However, the relative contributions of the aerosol sources to the OP are still poorly known. In order to better quantify the impact of different PM sources, we sampled aerosols in a French city for one year (2014, 115 samples). A coupled analysis with detailed chemical speciation (more than 100 species, including organic and carbonaceous compounds, ions, metals and aethalometer measurements) and two OP assays (ascorbic acid, AA, and dithiothreitiol, DTT) in a simulated lung fluid (SLF) were performed in these samples. We present in this study a statistical framework using a coupled approach with positive matrix factorization (PMF) and multiple linear regression to attribute a redox-activity to PM sources. Our results highlight the importance of the biomass burning and vehicular sources to explain the observed OP for both assays. In general, we see a different contribution of the sources when considering the OP AA, OP DTT or the mass of the PM10. Moreover, significant differences are observed between the DTT and AA tests which emphasized chemical specificities of the two tests and the need of a standardized approach for the future studies on epidemiology or toxicology of the PM.},

In this context, the SOURCES project has been set-up to gather and investigate in a harmonized way 15 datasets of chemical compounds from PM10 collected for PMF studies during a five-year period (2012\&ndash;2016) in France. The present paper aims at giving an overview of the results obtained within this project, notably illustrating the behavior of key primary sources as well as focusing on their statistical robustness and representativeness. Overall, wood burning for residential heating as well as road transport were confirmed to be the two main primary sources strongly influencing PM10 loadings across the country. While wood burning profiles, as well as those dominated by secondary inorganic aerosols, present a rather good homogeneity among the sites investigated, some significant variabilities were observed for primary traffic factors, illustrating the need to better characterize the diversity of the various vehicle exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. Finally, natural sources, such as sea salts (widely observed in internal mixing with anthropogenic compounds), primary biogenic aerosols and/or terrigenous particles, were also found as non-negligible PM10 components at every investigated site.},

  abstract = {Methods: We examined the relationship between PM2.5 oxidative burden and cause-specific mortality in Ontario, Canada. Integrated PM2.5 samples were collected from 30 provincial monitoring sites between 2012 and 2013. The oxidative potential (\% depletion/mg) of regional PM2.5 was measured as the ability of filter extracts to deplete antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbate) in a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid. PM2.5 oxidative burden was calculated as the product of PM2.5 mass concentrations and regional estimates of oxidative potential. In total, this study included 193,300 people who completed the Canadian long-form census in 1991 and who lived within 5 km of a site where oxidative potential was measured. Deaths occurring between 1991 and 2009 were identified through record linkages and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (and 95\% confidence intervals) for interquartile changes in exposure adjusting for individual-level covariates and indirect-adjustment for smoking and obesity.
Results: Glutathione-related oxidative burden was associated with cause-specific mortality. For lung cancer specifically, this metric was associated with a 12\% (95\% CI: 5.0–19) increased risk of mortality whereas a 5.0\% (95\% CI: 0.1, 10) increase was observed for PM2.5. Indirect adjustment for smoking and obesity decreased the lung cancer hazard ratio for glutathione-related oxidative burden but it remained significantly elevated (HR ¼1.07, 95\% CI: 1.005, 1.146). Ascorbate-related oxidative burden was not associated with mortality.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that glutathione-related oxidative burden may be more strongly associated with lung cancer mortality than PM2.5 mass concentrations.

  abstract = {Few studies have characterized within-city spatial variations in the oxidative potential of fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5). In this study, we evaluated multiple measures of PM2.5 oxidative potential across Toronto, Canada (2016–2017), including glutathione/ascorbate-related oxidative potential (OPGSH and OPAA) and dithiothreitol depletion (OPDTT). Integrated 2-week samples were collected from 67 sites in summer and 42 sites in winter. Multivariable linear models were developed to predict OP based on various land use/traffic factors, and PM2.5 metals and black carbon were also examined. All three measures of PM2.5 oxidative potential varied substantially across Toronto. OPAA and OPDTT were primarily associated with traffic-related components of PM2.5 (i.e., Fe, Cu, and black carbon) whereas OPGSH was not a strong marker for traffic during either season. During summer, multivariable models performed best for OPAA (RCV2 = 0.48) followed by OPDTT (RCV2 = 0.32) and OPGSH (RCV2 = 0.22). During winter, model performance was best for OPDTT (RCV2 = 0.55) followed by OPGSH (RCV2 = 0.50) and OPAA (RCV2 = 0.23). Model parameters varied between seasons, and between-season differences in PM2.5 mass concentrations were weakly/moderately correlated with seasonal differences in OP. Our findings highlight substantial within-city variations in PM2.5 oxidative potential. More detailed information is needed on local sources of air pollution to improve model performance.},

  abstract = {Selenium (Se) is an essential element for humans and animals, which occurs ubiquitously in the environment. It is present in trace amounts in both organic and inorganic forms in marine and freshwater systems, soils, biomass and in the atmosphere. Low Se levels in certain terrestrial environments have resulted in Se deficiency in humans, while elevated Se levels in waters and soils can be toxic and result in the death of aquatic wildlife and other animals. Human dietary Se intake is largely governed by Se concentrations in plants, which are controlled by root uptake of Se as a function of soil Se concentrations, speciation and bioavailability. In addition, plants and microorganisms can biomethylate Se, which can result in a loss of Se to the atmosphere. The mobilization of Se across soil-plant-atmosphere interfaces is thus of crucial importance for human Se status. This review gives an overview of current knowledge on Se cycling with a specific focus on soil-plant-atmosphere interfaces. Sources, speciation and mobility of Se in soils and plants will be discussed as well as Se hyperaccumulation by plants, biofortification and biomethylation. Future research on Se cycling in the environment is essential to minimize the adverse health effects associated with unsafe environmental Se levels.},

  abstract = {Oxidative potential (OP), which is the ability of certain components in atmospheric particles to generate reactive oxidative species (ROS) and deplete antioxidants in vivo, is a prevailing toxicological mechanism underlying the adverse health effects associated with exposure to ambient aerosols. While previous studies have identified the high OP of fresh biomass burning organic aerosols (BBOA), it remains unclear how it evolves throughout atmospheric transport. Using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay as a measure of OP, a combination of field observations and laboratory experiments is used to determine how atmospheric aging transforms the intrinsic OP (OPmassDTT) of BBOA. For ambient BBOA collected during the fire seasons in Greece, OPmassDTT was observed to increase by a factor of 2.1 ± 0.9 for samples of atmospheric ages up to 68 h. Laboratory experiments indicate that aqueous photochemical aging (aging by UVB and UVA photolysis; as well as OH oxidation), as well as aging by ozone and atmospheric dilution can transform the OPmassDTT of the water-soluble fraction of wood smoke within 2 days of atmospheric transport. The results from this work suggest that the air quality impacts of biomass burning emissions can extend beyond regions near fire sites and should be accounted for.},

Ambient (outdoor) air pollution alone kills around 3 million people each year, mainly from noncommunicable diseases. Air pollution continues to rise at an alarming rate, and affects economies and people's quality of life; it is a public health emergency. Interventions and policies for tackling air pollution issues exist and have been proven to be effective. Air pollution has also been identified as a global health priority in the sustainable development agenda. The role of the health sector is crucial, and there is a need to engage with other sectors to maximize the co-benefits of health, climate, environment, social and development. Saving people's lives is the overarching aim to implement policies aiming at tackling air pollution in the health, transport, energy, and urban development sectors.},

Three laboratory BB experiments were conducted with two U.S. pine forest understory fuels typical of those consumed during prescribed fires. During the experiments, submicron aerosol particles were collected on filter media and subsequently extracted with methanol and examined for their optical and chemical properties. Significant correlations (\emph{p} {$<$} 0.05) were observed between BrC absorption and elemental carbon (EC)/OC ratios for test specific data. However, the pooled experimental data indicated that the BB BrC absorption depends on more than the BB fire conditions as represented by the EC/OC ratio. Fourteen NACs were identified in the BB samples, four of which (C\textsubscript{10}H\textsubscript{11}NO\textsubscript{4}, C\textsubscript{10}H\textsubscript{11}NO\textsubscript{5}, C\textsubscript{11}H\textsubscript{13}NO\textsubscript{5} and C\textsubscript{11}H\textsubscript{13}NO\textsubscript{6}) have not been observed previously in chamber-based secondary organic aerosols, and are expected to have methoxyphenol-type structure specific to the pyrolized biomass lignin based on mass spectral evidence, suggesting these compounds may be unique to BB aerosols. The average total contribution of NACs to organic mass (0.023 ± 0.0089 to 0.18 ± 0.067\%) was 5\&ndash;10 times lower than the average contribution to the overall BrC absorption at 365nm (0.12 ± 0.047 to 2.44 ± 0.67\%). The average contributions (\%) of total NACs to organic mass and aqueous extracts absorption correlated significantly (\emph{p} {$<$} 0.05) with EC/OC for both test specific and pooled experimental data.

Seven PM0.1 source-factors were identified at all locations: Factor1- Gasoline+Motor Oil+Meat Cooking+Natural Gas+SOA (31–53\% PM0.1 mass), Factor 2- Diesel+Motor Oil (25–45\% PM0.1 mass), Factor 3-Wood Burning (6–12\% PM0.1 mass), Factor 4-Shipping and other heavy fuel oil combustion (2–3\% PM0.1 mass), Factor 5-Sea Spray (4–8\% PM0.1 mass), Factor 6-Sb Brake Wear (1–3\% PM0.1 mass) and Factor 7-Sn - Unknown (1–7\% PM0.1 mass). PM0.1 wood burning contributions were highest in the winter season when residential wood combustion was active. The monthly-averaged PM0.1 source apportionment results calculated by PMF are consistent with the PM0.1 source apportionment results calculated using Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) from the same sampling campaign. PMF distinguished Diesel+Motor Oil from Gasoline+Motor Oil+Meat Cooking+Natural Gas+SOA based on the species EC3 (a sub-fraction of elemental carbon that is volatilized and oxidized at temperatures between 700 and 775~°C), but PMF failed to further resolve the major sources of PM0.1 OC because unique tracers were not measured. PMF resolved “Shipping and other heavy fuel oil combustion” and Sea Spray sources based on inorganic tracers V and Br. The PMF factor rich in Sb very likely comes from brake wear associated with on-road vehicles and railway operations. The undefined Sn factor may be indicative of local industrial sources and traffic emission, but further research will be required to confirm this hypothesis. The PM0.1 source apportionment results contained in the current study further characterize the seasonal and spatial patterns of UFP concentrations in California.},

  abstract = {Introduction The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) has been proposed as a healthrelevant metric, but currently few epidemiological studies investigated associations of OP with health. Our main aim was to assess associations of long-term exposure to OP with respiratory health in children. Our second aim was to evaluate whether OP is more consistently associated with respiratory health than PM mass, PM composition or nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
Methods For 3701 participants of a prospective birth cohort, annual average concentrations of OP (assessed by spin resonance (OPESR) and dithiothreitol assay (OPDTT)), PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5) mass, NO2, and PM2.5 constituents at the home addresses at birth and at all follow-up addresses were estimated by land-use regression. Repeated questionnaire reports of asthma and hay fever until age 14 years, and measurements of allergic sensitisation, lung function and fractional exhaled nitric oxide at age 12 years were linked with air pollution concentrations.
Results Asthma incidence, prevalence of asthma symptoms and rhinitis were positively associated with OPDTT (adjusted OR (95\% CI) per IQR increase in exposure 1.10 (1.01 to 1.20), 1.08 (1.02 to 1.16), 1.15 (1.05 to 1.26), respectively). These associations persisted after adjustment for most co-pollutants. Forced expiratory volume in 1s and forced vital capacity were negatively associated with OPDTT. These associations were sensitive to adjustment for NO2. Respiratory health was not significantly associated with PM2.5 mass and OPESR.
Conclusions Respiratory health was more strongly associated with OPDTT than with PM2.5 mass; OPDTT associations with lung function, but not symptoms, were sensitive to adjustment for NO2.},

Different assays exist for measuring OP and their methodologies vary in the choice of extraction solvent and filter type. Little is known about the impact of extraction and filter type on reported OP. Four a-cellular assays; electron spin resonance (ESR), dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbate acid depletion (AA) and reductive acridinium triggering (CRAT) assay were chosen to evaluate whether these differences affect the OP measurement, the correlation between OP from different assays and the association with PM chemical composition. We analysed 15 urban 48e72 h PM2.5 samples collected on quartz and Teflon filters. The choice of extraction solvent had only a significant effect on OPDTT, while all OP measures for quartz filters were heavily attenuated. OP values derived from quartz were, however, highly correlated with those derived from Teflon. OPDTT correlated highly with OPCRAT, and OPESR correlated highly with OPAA. These correlations were affected by the choice of filter type. Correlations between OP and PM chemical composition were not affected by filter type and extraction solvent. These findings indicate that the measurement of relative OP reactivity is not greatly influenced by filter type and extraction solvent for the investigated assays. This robustness is also promising for exploratory use in monitoring and subsequent epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {A number of studies have provided evidence on the association between particulate matter (PM) and adverse health effects. However, PM is a mix of heterogeneous composition that varies greatly by season and region. Epidemiological studies rely primarily on spatial variation of the air pollutants to estimate the associations between exposure to air pollutants and health effects. Since PM components exhibit a great deal of spatial variability, additional monitoring campaign and more refined exposure models are still needed. To our knowledge, the exposure assessment methods for PM components in epidemiological studies haven’t been reviewed. Hence, in this review, we summarize several exposure assessment methods which have been applied in estimating the associations between PM components and adverse health effects in epidemiological studies. Many concerns have been accumulated on the potential health effects of PM components with very little evidence focusing on the exposure assessment of PM components in living and work place. Thus, it is quite important to develop exposure models that cover both outdoor and indoor environments for PM components.},

Though most studies have used PM mass concentration as the exposure metric, an alternative which accounts for particle toxicity due to varying particle composition may better elucidate whether PM from specific sources is responsible for observed health effects. The oxidative potential (OP) of PM {$<$} 10 μm (PM10) was measured as the rate of depletion of the antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH) in a model of human respiratory tract lining fluid. Using a database of GSH OP measures collected in greater London, U.K. from 2002 to 2006, we developed and validated a predictive spatiotemporal model of the weekly GSH OP of PM10 that included geographic predictors. Predicted levels of OP were then used in combination with those of weekly PM10 mass to estimate exposure to PM10 weighted by its OP. Using cross-validation (CV), brake and tire wear emissions of PM10 from traffic within 50 m and tailpipe emissions of nitrogen oxides from heavy-goods vehicles within 100 m were important predictors of GSH OP levels. Predictive accuracy of the models was high for PM10 (CV R2=0.83) but only moderate for GSH OP (CV R2 = 0.44) when comparing weekly levels; however, the GSH OP model predicted spatial trends well (spatial CV R2 = 0.73). Results suggest that PM10 emitted from traffic sources, specifically brake and tire wear, has a higher OP than that from other sources, and that this effect is very local, occurring within 50−100 m of roadways.},

  abstract = {Airborne particulate matter (PM) is important because it causes health problems and environmental degradation and accordingly many countries implement programs to control PM pollution (e.g., EPA, 1996). In recent years the emphasis on controlling PM pollution has shifted toward problems associated with fine PM (PM2.5 with particle diameter less than 2.5 μm) because it is more strongly associated with serious health effects than coarse PM. Knowing what sources contribute to fine PM2.5 is essential for developing effective control strategies. Many components of PM2.5 are secondary pollutants and so photochemical models are important tools for PM air quality planning. The Comprehensive Air quality Model with extensions CAMx; (ENVIRON, 2003) is one of the photochemical grid models being used to understand PM pollution and visibility impairment in the US and Europe. The Particulate Matter Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) has been developed for CAMx to provide geographic and source category specific PM source apportionment.

Statistical treatment of data from thermal-optical, \textsuperscript{14}C and organic tracer analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling has allowed for quantitative estimates of seven different sources contributing to the ambient carbonaceous aerosol. These are: elemental carbon from combustion of biomass (EC\textsubscript{bb}) and fossil fuel (EC\textsubscript{ff}), primary and secondary organic carbon arising from combustion of biomass (OC\textsubscript{bb}) and fossil fuel (OC\textsubscript{ff}), primary biological aerosol particles (OC\textsubscript{PBAP}, which includes plant debris, OC\textsubscript{pbc}, and fungal spores, OC\textsubscript{pbs}), and secondary organic aerosol from biogenic precursors (OC\textsubscript{BSOA}). {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Our results show that emissions from natural sources were particularly abundant in summer, and with a more pronounced influence at the rural compared to the urban background site. 80\% of total carbon (TC\textsubscript{p}, corrected for the positive artefact) in PM\textsubscript{10} and ca. 70\% of TC\textsubscript{p}in PM\textsubscript{1} could be attributed to natural sources at the rural background site in summer. Natural sources account for about 50\% of TC\textsubscript{p} in PM\textsubscript{10} at the urban background site as well. The natural source contribution was always dominated by OC\textsubscript{BSOA}, regardless of season, site and size fraction. During winter anthropogenic sources totally dominated the carbonaceous aerosol (80–90\%). Combustion of biomass contributed slightly more than fossil-fuel sources in winter, whereas emissions from fossil-fuel sources were more abundant in summer. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Mass closure calculations show that PCM made significant contributions to the mass concentration of the ambient PM regardless of size fraction, season, and site. A larger fraction of PM\textsubscript{1} (ca. 40–60\%) was accounted for by carbonaceous matter compared to PM\textsubscript{10} (ca. 40–50\%), but only by a small margin. In general, there were no pronounced differences in the relative contribution of carbonaceous matter to PM with respect to season or between the two sites.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We assessed the interactions among the particulate matter (PM) components in generating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on a dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. We started with the standard solutions of known redox-active substances, i.e., quinones (9,10-phenanthraquinone, 1,2-naphthoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) and metals [Fe (II), Mn (II), and Cu (II)]. Both DTT consumption and hydroxyl radical (·OH) generation were measured in the DTT assay. The interactions of Fe were additive with quinones in DTT consumption but strongly synergistic in ·OH generation. Cu showed antagonistic interactions with quinones in both DTT consumption and ·OH generation. Mn interacted synergistically with quinones in DTT oxidation but antagonistically in ·OH generation. The nature of the interactions of these metals (Fe, Mn, and Cu) with ambient humic-like substances (HULIS) resembled that with quinones, although the intensity of interactions were weaker in DTT consumption than ·OH generation. Finally, we demonstrated that the DTT consumption capability of ambient PM can be well explained by HULIS, three transition metals (Fe, Mn, and Cu), and their interactions, but ·OH generation involves a contribution (∼50\%) from additional compounds (aliphatic species or metals other than Fe, Mn, and Cu) present in the hydrophilic PM fraction. The study highlights the need to account for the interactions between organic compounds and metals, while apportioning the relative contributions of chemical components in the PM oxidative potential.},

  abstract = {Outdoor air pollution is a global health concern, but detailed exposure information is still limited for many parts of the world. In this study, high-resolution exposure surfaces were generated for annual and seasonal fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10), and carbon monoxide (CO) for the Greater Beirut Area (GBA), Lebanon, an urban zone with a complex topography and multiple source contributions. Land use regression models (LUR) were calibrated and validated with monthly data collected from 58 locations between March 2017 and March 2018. The annual mean (±1 SD) concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO across the monitoring locations were 68.1 (±15.7) μg/m3, 83.5 (±19.5) μg/m3, and 2.48 (±1.12) ppm, respectively. The coefficients of determination for LUR models ranged from 56 to 67\% for PM2.5, 44 to 63\% for the PM10 models, and 50 to 60\% for the CO. LUR model structures varied significantly by season for both PM2.5 and PM10 but not for CO. Traffic emissions were consistently the main source of CO emissions throughout the year. The relative importance of industrial emissions and power generation sources towards predicted PM levels increased during the hot season while the contribution of the international airport diminished. Moreover, the complex topography of the study area along with the seasonal changes in the predominant wind directions affected the spatial predicted concentrations of all three pollutants. Overall, the predicted exposure surfaces were able to conserve the inter-pollution correlations determined from the field monitoring campaign, with the exception of the cold season. Our pollution surfaces suggest that the entire population of Beirut is regularly exposed to concentrations exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards for both PM2.5 and PM10.},

  abstract = {Since 1980, the Acid Precipitation in Ontario Study (APIOS) Event Wet/Dry Deposition Network has collected a substantial precipitation chemical data base. Data from the three stations in Dorset, Kingston and London were selected for investigation of the sources of the constituents found in the collected precipitation. Factor analysis was applied to the chemical data sets. Three factors reproduce the concentrations observed in precipitation. These factors represent the acid gas sources (SO2 and NOx sources), Ca and Mg sources, and Na and Cl sources (marine aerosol). The acid gas sources are responsible for the acidity of the precipitation. To locate these sources in terms of geographic region; air parcel back trajectories corresponding to the precipitation sample time periods are incorporated into factor analysis with the chemical data. This information is in the form of the geographic distribution of back trajectory endpoints. The region in which the trajectory endpoints fall is divided into subregions. New variables are defined as the number of the endpoints in each of the subregions. They reflect the residence time of the air parcels in the subregions. Factor analysis is applied to the combined chemical and endpoint variable data sets. The results show the relationship between the chemical nature of the sources and the geographic regions that the air parcels passed. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) is another approach to locate the sources. PSCF is a conditional probability function. It can be calculated for each 1° longitude by 1° latitude cell by dividing the number of trajectory endpoints that correspond to samples with factor scores or pollutant concentrations greater than specified values by the number of total endpoints in the cell. Source areas are indicated by high PSCF values. Both of the approaches suggest that the Ohio River Valley and some areas along the east coast are major source areas for the observed precipitation acidity in Ontario.},

  abstract = {Background: Exposure to air pollution has been associated with cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. However, the chemical constituents and pollution sources underlying these associations remain unclear.
Method: We conducted a cohort panel study involving 97 elderly subjects living in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Airway and circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were measured weekly over 12 weeks and included, exhaled breath condensate malondialdehyde (EBC MDA), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6). Exposures included 7-day personal nitrogen oxides (NOx), daily criteria-pollutant data, five-day average particulate matter (PM) measured in three size-fractions and characterized by chemical components including transition metals, and in vitro PM oxidative potential (dithiothreitol and macrophage reactive oxygen species). Associations between biomarkers and pollutants were assessed using linear mixed effects regression models.
Results: We found significant positive associations of airway oxidative stress and inflammation with traffic-related air pollutants, ultrafine particles and transition metals. Positive but nonsignificant associations were observed with PM oxidative potential. The strongest associations were observed among PM variables in the ultrafine range (PM o 0.18 mm). It was estimated that an interquartile increase in 5-day average ultrafine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was associated with a 6.3\% (95\% CI: 1.1\%, 11.6\%) increase in EBC MDA and 6.7\% (95\% CI: 3.4\%, 10.2\%) increase in FeNO. In addition, positive but nonsignificant associations were observed between oxLDL and traffic-related pollutants, ultrafine particles and transition metals while plasma IL-6 was positively associated with 1-day average traffic-related pollutants.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that exposure to pollutants with high oxidative potential (traffic-related pollutants, ultrafine particles, and transition metals) may lead to increased airway oxidative stress and inflammation in elderly adults. This observation was less clear with circulating biomarkers.},

  abstract = {PM2.5 pollution is of great concern in China due to its adverse health effects. Many diseases have been proven to be associated with PM2.5 components, but the effects of chemical characteristics of PM2.5 on toxicological properties, especially in different human organs, are poorly understood. In this study, two seasonal PM2.5 samples (summer and winter) were collected in Nanjing, and their chemical compositions (heavy metals, water-soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC)) were analyzed. Human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (A549), human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG2), and human neuroblastoma cells (Sh-Sy5y) were employed to evaluate the toxicological properties of the collected PM2.5. The results showed that the average mass concentrations of PM2.5 were lower in summer (51.3 \&plusmn; 21.4 \&mu;g/m3) than those in winter (62.1 \&plusmn; 21.5 \&mu;g/m3). However, the mass fractions of heavy metals, OC, and EC exhibited an opposite seasonal difference. Among all tested fractions, water-soluble ions were the major compositions of particles in both summer and winter, especially the secondary ions (SO42\&minus;, NO3\&minus; and NH4+). Besides, the ratio of OC/EC in PM2.5 was greater than two, indicating serious secondary pollution in this area. The NO3\&ndash;/SO42\&minus; ratio (\&lt; 1) suggested that fixed sources made important contributions. The toxicological results showed that PM2.5 in the summer and winter significantly inhibited cell viability (p \&lt; 0.01) and induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (p \&lt; 0.01). Moreover, the viability inhibition in A549, Sh-Sy5y, and HepG2 cells was more prominent in summer, especially at high PM2.5 (400 \&mu;g/mL) (p \&lt; 0.05), and the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A549 and Sh-Sy5y cells was also more evident in summer. Such seasonal differences might be related to the variations of PM2.5 components.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric secondary organic aerosols (SOA) play an important role in the global particulate matter budget, and their chemical compositions determine critical properties that impact radiative forcing and human health. During temporal and spatial transport, atmospheric particles undergo ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH) changes or cycles that may transform their chemical compositions. Here, we report compositional evolution of SOA from α-pinene ozonolysis in a smog chamber as the temperature and RH cycle within atmospherically relevant ranges (5 – 35 °C; 10 – 80\% RH). The results suggest that the organic vapor condensation is limited during cooling, in contrast to volatility-based predictions, likely due to high viscosity of the α-pinene SOA particles and the potential enrichment of semi-volatile products in the particle surface region. Combining a number of on-line and off-line aerosol bulk and molecular-level measurements, we determine that particle-phase reactions occur reversibly and irreversibly throughout the temperature/RH cycles, substantially modifying concentrations of the SOA constituents and forming new products. Further, the presence of water is found to enhance the SOA O:C ratios prominently during cooling (high RH). These findings have important implications for understanding the chemical evolution of SOA in the atmosphere through their lifetime and long-range transport.},

The stability of the ROS was assessed by comparing the ROS concentration measured by the same instrumentation online in-situ with offline measurements. We also analyzed the evolution of ROS in specific samples by conducting the analysis after storage times of up to four months. The ROS were observed to decay with increasing storage duration. From their decay behavior, ROS in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) can be separated into short- and long-lived fractions, with an average half-life of \textasciitilde\&amp;\#8201;1.7\&amp;\#8201;h and \textasciitilde\&amp;\#8201;432\&amp;\#8201;d, respectively. All these measurements showed consistently that, on average 60\&amp;\#8201;\&amp;\#177;\&amp;\#8201;20\&amp;\#8201;\% of the ROS were very reactive and disappeared during the filter storage time.

The instrument detection limit determined as 3~times the noise is 1.3 nmol L−1 for offline analysis and 2 nmol m−3 of sampled air when the instrument is operated online at a fluorescence response time of approximately 8 min, while the offline method detection limit is 18 nmol L−1. Potential interferences from gas-phase O3 and NO2 as well as matrix effects of particulate SO42− and NO3− were tested, but not observed. Fe3+ had no influence on the ROS signal, while soluble Fe2+ reduced it if present at high concentrations in the extracts. Both online and offline methods were applied to identify the ROS content of different aerosol types, i.e., ambient aerosols as well as fresh and aged aerosols from wood combustion emissions. The stability of the ROS was assessed by comparing the ROS concentration measured by the same instrumentation online in situ with offline measurements. We also analyzed the evolution of ROS in specific samples by conducting the analysis after storage times of up to 4~months. The ROS were observed to decay with increasing storage duration. From their decay behavior, ROS in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) can be separated into short- and long-lived fractions. The half-life of the short-lived fraction was 1.7 ± 0.4 h, while the half-life of the long-lived fraction could not be determined with our uncertainties. All these measurements showed consistently that on average 60 ± 20 \% of the ROS were very reactive and disappeared during the filter storage time. This demonstrates the importance of a fast online measurement of ROS.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Wood combustion emissions can induce oxidative stress in the human respiratory tract by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the aerosol particles, which are emitted either directly or formed through oxidation in the atmosphere. To improve our understanding of the particle-bound ROS (PB-ROS) generation potential of wood combustion emissions, a suite of smog chamber (SC) and potential aerosol mass (PAM) chamber experiments were conducted under well-determined conditions for different combustion devices and technologies, different fuel types, operation methods, combustion regimes, combustion phases, and aging conditions. The PB-ROS content and the chemical properties of the aerosols were quantified by a novel ROS analyzer using the DCFH (2\textsuperscript{′},7\textsuperscript{′}-dichlorofluorescin) assay and a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). For all eight combustion devices tested, primary PB-ROS concentrations substantially increased upon aging. The level of primary and aged PB-ROS emission factors (EF\textsubscript{ROS}) were dominated by the combustion device (within different combustion technologies) and to a greater extent by the combustion regimes: the variability within one device was much higher than the variability of EF\textsubscript{ROS} from different devices. Aged EF\textsubscript{ROS} under bad combustion conditions were ∼\&thinsp;2–80 times higher than under optimum combustion conditions. EF\textsubscript{ROS} from automatically operated combustion devices were on average 1 order of magnitude lower than those from manually operated devices, which indicates that automatic combustion devices operated at optimum conditions to achieve near-complete combustion should be employed to minimize PB-ROS emissions. The use of an electrostatic precipitator decreased the primary and aged ROS emissions by a factor of ∼\&thinsp;1.5 which is however still within the burn-to-burn variability. The parameters controlling the PB-ROS formation in secondary organic aerosol were investigated by employing a regression model, including the fractions of the mass-to-charge ratios \emph{m}∕\emph{z} 44 and 43 in secondary organic aerosol (SOA; \emph{f}\textsubscript{44−SOA} and \emph{f}\textsubscript{43−SOA}), the OH exposure, and the total organic aerosol mass. The regression model results of the SC and PAM chamber aging experiments indicate that the PB-ROS content in SOA seems to increase with the SOA oxidation state, which initially increases with OH exposure and decreases with the additional partitioning of semi-volatile components with lower PB-ROS content at higher OA concentrations, while further aging seems to result in a decay of PB-ROS. The results and the special data analysis methods deployed in this study could provide a model for PB-ROS analysis of further wood or other combustion studies investigating different combustion conditions and aging methods.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are believed to contribute to the adverse health effects of aerosols. This may happen by inhaled particle-bound (exogenic) ROS (PB-ROS) or by ROS formed within the respiratory tract by certain aerosol components (endogenic ROS). We investigated the chemical composition of aerosols and their exogenic ROS content at the two contrasting locations Beijing (China) and Bern (Switzerland). We apportioned the ambient organic aerosol to different sources and attributed the observed water-soluble PB-ROS to them. The oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA, a proxy for secondary organic aerosol, SOA) explained the highest fraction of the exogenic ROS concentration variance at both locations. We also characterized primary and secondary aerosol emissions generated from different biogenic and anthropogenic sources in smog chamber experiments. The exogenic PB-ROS content in the OOA from these emission sources was comparable to that in the ambient measurements. Our results imply that SOA from gaseous precursors of different anthropogenic emission sources is a crucial source of water-soluble PB-ROS and should be additionally considered in toxicological and epidemiological studies in an adequate way besides primary emissions. The importance of PB-ROS may be connected to the seasonal trends in health effects of PM reported by epidemiological studies, with elevated incidences of adverse effects in warmer seasons, which are accompanied by more-intense atmospheric oxidation processes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress may be a fundamental mode of injury associated with inspired particles. To examine this, we determined the ability of three carbon black particles (CBPs; M120, M880, and R250) and two forms of silicon dioxide, amorphous (Cabosil) and crystalline (DQ12) quartz, to deplete epithelium lining fluid antioxidant defenses. Single and composite antioxidant solutions of uric acid, ascorbic acid (AA), and reduced glutathione (GSH) were examined in the presence of particle concentrations of 150 μg/ml. Uric acid was not depleted by any particle considered. AA was depleted in a near-linear fashion with time by the three different CBPs; however, AA depletion rates varied markedly with CBP type and decreased in the presence of metal chelators. An initially high GSH depletion rate was noted with all CBPs, and this was always accompanied by the appearance of oxidized glutathione. Exposure to Cabosil or DQ12 did not result in the loss of GSH. Together, these data demonstrate that particle type, size, and surface area are all important factors when considering particle-antioxidant interactions in the airways.},
